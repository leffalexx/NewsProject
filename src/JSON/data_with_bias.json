Bad weather has hampered progress getting aid into Gaza from the pier, while the Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it difficult, if not impossible at times, to get aid into the region by land routes.', 'Aid groups have had mixed reactions — both welcoming any amount of aid for starving Palestinians besieged by the nearly eight-month-old Israel-Hamas war and decrying the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive.', 'It’s “a side-show,” said Bob Kitchen, a top official of the International Rescue Committee.

        "article": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s military said Wednesday it seized control of a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt to cut off smuggling tunnels as it tries to destroy the militant Hamas group in a war now in its eighth month.', 'The capture of the Philadelphi Corridor could complicate Israel’s relations with Egypt, which has complained about Israel’s advance toward its border. Israel says the corridor is awash in tunnels that have funneled weapons and other goods for Hamas — despite a yearslong blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt.', 'Israel also deepened its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands have been seeking shelter from fighting, and where intensifying violence in recent days has killed dozens of Palestinians. The military said that a fifth brigade — up to several thousand soldiers — joined troops operating in the city on Tuesday.', 'Egypt says any increase in troops in the strategic border area would violate the countries’ 1979 peace accord. It already has complained about Israel taking over the Rafah border crossing, the only crossing between Gaza and Egypt. ', '“The Philadelphi Corridor served as the oxygen line of Hamas through which Hamas carried out weapons smuggling into Gaza on a regular basis,” said Israel’s military chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. ', 'An Israeli military official said Israel had notified Egypt of the takeover. Some 20 tunnels, including some previously unknown to Israel, were found, as well as 82 access points to the tunnels, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations. It was not clear if the tunnels were currently in use.', 'The corridor is part of a larger demilitarized zone along the entire Israel-Egypt border. Under the peace accord, each side is allowed to deploy only a small number of troops or border guards in the zone, though those numbers can be modified by mutual agreement. At the time of the accord, Israeli troops controlled Gaza, until Israel withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005.', 'Egypt’s state-run Al-Qahera News TV reported there were “no communications with the Israeli side” on the allegations of finding tunnels on the border. Egypt has repeatedly expressed concerns that the Israeli offensive could push Palestinians across the border — a scenario Egypt says is unacceptable.', 'The narrow corridor — about 100 meters (yards) wide in parts — runs the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt and includes the Rafah crossing into Egypt.', 'Hamas has had free rein of the border since its 2007 takeover of Gaza.', 'Smuggling tunnels were dug under the Gaza-Egypt border to get around the Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed after Hamas took over. Some of the tunnels were large enough for vehicles. Hamas brought in weapons and supplies, and Gaza residents smuggled in commercial goods, from livestock to construction materials.', 'That changed over the past decade, as Egypt battled Islamic militants in Sinai. The Egyptian military cracked down on the tunnels and destroyed hundreds of them.', 'The Israeli military official said Israel has also taken “tactical control” of Tel al-Sultan, a neighborhood on Rafah’s northwest edge. But he said the incursion into the city remains a “limited scope and scale operation.” ', 'White House national security spokesman John Kirby said seizure of the Philadelphi Corridor would be consistent with the “limited” ground operation Israeli officials briefed President Joe Biden’s team on for the city of Rafah.', '“When they briefed us on their plans for Rafah it did include moving along that corridor and out of the city proper to put pressure on Hamas in the city,” Kirby told reporters Wednesday.', 'Meanwhile, deadly violence continued. The Gaza Health Ministry said an apparent Israeli strike killed two ambulance crew members on their way to evacuate casualties in Tel al-Sultan.', 'Earlier Wednesday, a top Israeli official said the war was likely to last through the end of the year — a grim prediction for a conflict that has killed tens of thousands, deepened Israel’s global isolation and brought the region to the brink of a wider conflagration.', 'Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, told Kan public radio he was “expecting another seven months of fighting” to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.', 'The army has said from the start the “war will be long,” he said. “They have designated 2024 as a year of war.”', 'Hanegbi’s remarks raise questions about the future of Gaza and what role Israel will play in it. The United States, Israel’s top ally, has demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decide on a postwar vision for the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu’s defense minister and a top governing partner have warned he must take steps to ensure that Israel isn’t bogged down in Gaza indefinitely. ', 'The war has already devastated Gaza’s urban landscape, displaced most of its population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger. It has opened Israel up to international legal scrutiny, with world courts faulting it over its wartime conduct, sparked disagreements with the White House, and on Tuesday prompted three European nations to formally recognize a Palestinian state.', 'Israel says it must dismantle Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah and will seek indefinite security control over the Gaza Strip, even after the war ends. Still, it has yet to achieve its main goals of dismantling Hamas and returning scores of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.', 'Beyond Rafah, Israeli forces were still battling militants in parts of Gaza the military said it wrested control of months ago — potential signs of a low-level insurgency that could keep Israeli troops engaged in the territory. ', 'The fighting in Rafah has displaced 1 million people, the United Nations says, most of whom were already displaced from other parts of Gaza. ', 'Residents said fighting was underway in the city center and on the outskirts of Tel al-Sultan, the same neighborhood where an Israeli strike over the weekend ignited a fire that swept through an encampment for displaced people, killing dozens. Israel said it was investigating and the blaze may have been caused by a secondary explosion.', 'A floating pier built by the U.S. to surge aid into the territory was damaged in bad weather, another setback to efforts to bring food to starving Palestinians. Gaza’s land crossings are now entirely controlled by Israel. ', 'The U.S. and other allies have warned against a full-fledged offensive in Rafah, with the Biden administration saying this would cross a “red line” and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.

        "article": "NEW YORK (AP) — Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has been sitting for hours a day in a Manhattan courtroom, where his hush-money trial is nearing its end. On Monday, a trial is set to begin in Wilmington, Delaware, for President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who is accused of lying on a federal gun purchase form. ', 'While presidents have been deposed in criminal matters, impeached and pardoned, and their family members entangled in legal scrapes before, never has the criminal courtroom taken center stage in a presidential election like this.', '“It’s so unusual that we lack the terminology to express how unusual it is,” said presidential historian Lindsay Chervinsky, author of the upcoming book, “Making the Presidency: John Adams and the Precedents That Forged the Republic.” ', 'The two criminal cases are in no way the same. One involves the conduct of a former president who is running to reclaim the White House, yet stands accused of falsifying business records to conceal an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election. The other focuses on a private citizen — albeit the current president’s son — who is facing charges of lying on a federal gun-purchase form when he claimed he wasn’t using drugs. ', 'Politically, though, there is some obvious overlap. Both men say they’re being persecuted by overzealous prosecutors and unfairly targeted for political gain. And both sides are seeking to capitalize on highly personal and potentially embarrassing witness testimony about their adversaries, with Republicans trying to use Hunter Biden as a sort of target by proxy for the president himself. ', 'Trump has leaned hard into the politics of the moment, campaigning from court, claiming he’s the subject of a “witch hunt” and casting doubt on the validity of the nation’s criminal justice system. Biden, for his part, has largely steered clear, a purposeful effort to highlight the independence of the judiciary. ', 'What to know about the 2024 Election', 'But this week, Biden’s campaign decided that Trump’s case — the first of four criminal cases and quite possibly the only one to go to trial before the 2024 election — couldn’t be ignored any longer. The campaign brought in actor Robert De Niro and law enforcement officers who had defended the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, to denounce Trump in a press conference near the lower Manhattan courthouse. ', 'Biden campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said the press conference was called because reporters are “incessantly covering this day in and day out.”', '“And we want to remind the American people ahead of the first debate on June 27, of the unique, persistent and growing threat that Donald Trump poses to the American people and to our democracy,” he said. ', 'Trump’s operation was quick to follow team Biden to the same bank of microphones to deride the press conference as evidence of “a desperate and failing and pathetic campaign who knows that they are losing,” in the words of Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.', 'Inside, meanwhile, jurors were hearing closing arguments in Trump’s hush money trial. ', 'Prosecutors say Trump and his allies mounted a campaign to purchase and squelch potentially embarrassing stories, and cover up those payments in an illegal effort to influence voters in the waning weeks before the 2016 presidential election, particularly as Republicans grew concerned over potential fallout from the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women sexually without their permission. ', 'To help make their case to jurors, prosecutors relied on checkered characters from Trump’s orbit including porn actor Stormy Daniels, who testified about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The prosecution’s most important witness was Trump’s former lawyer- turned-foe Michael Cohen, who paid off Daniels and who placed Trump at the center of the scheme he denies. ', 'Throughout, Trump has strategically positioned prominent allies in the audience of the courtroom and used the trial as a fundraising pitch. These allies have held press conferences in a small park nearby where they decry the criminal justice system. Trump’s family, too, has appeared in court. ', 'In contrast, Hunter Biden has been largely on his own in public to face his legal problems. ', 'Republicans have relentlessly dug into his personal life, struggles with addiction and business dealings, trying — unsuccessfully — to link those dealings to the president. Hunter Biden was silent for years amid GOP criticism. But as his case looms, he has gone on the offense, arguing publicly that he’s being unfairly targeted. ', 'President Biden has said he loves his son and doesn’t generally comment on the details of his son’s case. But the president has already been put in the unusual if not awkward position of ruling out a pardon should his son be convicted. He is scheduled to head to France for a D-Day commemoration as Hunter Biden’s case begins.', 'White House aides say they’re concerned about the toll the trial will take on the president and first lady, who remain deeply concerned about the health, well-being and sobriety of their son. Privately, some Democrats have expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s legal problems could harm the president’s reelection campaign and even pose difficulties for Democrats in tight House races.', 'White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday the president was focused on the American people, not the trials. ', '“The president and the first lady, they love their son. They are proud of how their son has been able to get back on his feet and continue his progress and will continue to support him,” she said. ', 'Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to tax and gun charges after a plea deal collapsed last year that would have spared him — and his father -- the spectacle of a trial. His defense attorney Abbe Lowell has argued prosecutors then “buckled under political pressure” to indict the president’s son as Republicans and Trump rained down criticism of the proposed plea deal and claimed the younger Biden was getting special treatment. ', 'The proposed list of questions for prospective jurors includes: “Raise your hand if you do not believe in this statement: The law should apply equally to all, including the son of the president.” ', 'The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. Hunter Biden bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs. ', 'Prosecutors are planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden’s published memoir, and they may also introduce articles from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The articles made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos and messages.', 'They’re also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and his brother’s widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved. Prosecutors hope to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun. ', 'The court documents do not name them, but it’s clear from context that “witness three” describes Hallie Biden, who saw Hunter Biden using drugs many times, and according to the court documents: “searched his bags, backpacks, and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober, and discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs in his possession on multiple occasions.” ', 'Biden visited Hallie Biden last weekend, prompting questions about whether they’d talked about the upcoming case. ', 'Jean-Pierre said the visit was “not about that,” but rather about the approaching anniversary of Beau’s death.

The Associated Press checked them out.', 'Judge in Trump’s hush money trial did not bar campaign finance expert from testifying for defense', 'CLAIM: New York Judge Juan M. Merchan wouldn’t let the defense call campaign finance expert Bradley A. Smith to testify in former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial.', 'THE FACTS: Merchan did not bar Smith from testifying. Trump’s legal team chose to not call on him after the judge on Monday declined to broaden the scope of questioning the defense could pursue. The ruling echoed his pretrial ruling on the matter. Social media users misrepresented Merchan’s ruling, repeating a statement Trump made that Smith, a law professor and former Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, was not being allowed to take the stand.', '“The expert witness that we have, the best there is in election law, Brad Smith, he’s considered the Rolls Royce, or we’ll bring it back to an American car, Cadillac, but the best there is,” Trump said on his way out of court on Monday. “He can’t testify. He’s not being allowed to testify.”', 'The former president reiterated this falsehood several more times in his post-trial comments, claiming that Merchan was blocking Smith’s testimony “because he’s going to say we did nothing wrong.” He also posted about it on his social media platform Truth Social later that evening, calling Merchan’s decision “election interference.”', 'Other social media users then repeated Trump’s claim.', '“Biden-Donor Judge Merchan won’t allow the former FEC Commissioner to testify on behalf of Trump because he would have said that Trump did not violate any federal election laws!” reads one X post that had received more than 8,600 likes and shares as of Thursday. “This trial is totally rigged!”', 'But Smith was permitted to testify. The defense decided not to call him after Merchan reaffirmed a pretrial ruling that limited what he could have spoken about. The defense rested its case on Tuesday after calling two witnesses to testify — Daniel Sitko, a paralegal who works in the law office of Trump attorney Todd Blanche, and Robert Costello, a former federal prosecutor in New York.', 'Merchan said that, if called, Smith could give general background about the FEC — for example, it’s purpose and the laws it enforces — and provide definitions for terms such as “campaign contribution.” He rejected the Trump team’s renewed efforts to have Smith define three terms in federal election law on the basis that doing so would breach rules preventing expert witnesses from interpreting the law. Nor could Smith opine on whether the former president’s alleged actions violate those laws.', 'The judge said if Smith did testify, the prosecution would then be permitted to call an expert of its own, resulting in a “battle of the experts” that “would only serve to confuse and not assist the jury.”', 'Smith, who was appointed to the FEC by former President Bill Clinton, acknowledged in an X post on Monday that he did not testify because of a decision made by the defense. He added that he had intended to testify about complicated background knowledge necessary to understanding the case, rather than about the law.', '“Judge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me,” Smith wrote.', 'Trump distorts use of ‘deadly force’ language in FBI document for Mar-a-Lago search', 'CLAIM: The Biden administration authorized the use of “deadly force” against former President Donald Trump during an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.', 'THE FACTS: The policy statement on the “use of deadly force,” which appeared in an operations order for the Mar-a-Lago search, is not evidence of a plot to kill Trump. It is a Department of Justice policy that is standard to include in such documents.', '“The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,” the agency said in a statement. “No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.”', 'As it appears in the operations order, the policy stipulates in part that Department of Justice officers “may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.”', 'The policy is in the department’s Justice Manual with only minor differences in wording to what is included in the order and is summarized on the FBI’s website. It is meant to limit the use of deadly force.', 'Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, reiterated in an X post what the agency said in its statement.', '“Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy,” he wrote. “Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.”', 'A motion that Trump’s lawyers filed in his federal classified documents case, also unsealed Tuesday, asserted that the August 2022 search was unconstitutional and “illegal,” omitting “only” in the portion of the policy that says “law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.”', 'Trump wasn’t at Mar-a-Lago, which was shuttered for the season, at the time of the search. The Associated Press reported at the time that the FBI reached out to the Secret Service detail that provides protection to the former president and his homes shortly before serving the warrant.', 'The facts did not stop Trump and his allies from spreading the erroneous allegation.', 'A Trump campaign fundraising email with the subject line, “They were authorized to shoot me!” was sent soon after he posted about the document on social media, making outrageous claims.', '“I nearly escaped death,” it reads. “You know they’re just itching to do the unthinkable. ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.”', 'Asked if Trump stands by the false claims, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an email: “This is a sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden who is the most corrupt president in history and a threat to our democracy.”', 'Hard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, wrote in an X post that “the Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.”', 'Kari Lake, a Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, wrote in her own X post: “The sicko Biden FBI were ready to use deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago BS raid. That tells you everything you need to know about this criminal Biden admin.”', 'Trump was charged in June 2023 with illegally retaining classified documents taken with him from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after he left office in January 2021, and then obstructing government demands to give them back. Additional related charges were filed a month later. The FBI searched Mar-a-Lago as part of a probe that led to the indictment.', 'A warrant for Netanyahu’s arrest was requested. But no decision was made about whether to issue it', 'CLAIM: The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.', 'THE FACTS: ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over actions taken during the Israel-Hamas war. A panel of three judges will now decide whether to issue the warrants and allow a case to proceed. Such decisions typically take two months.', 'Social media users misrepresented the warrants’ status, claiming that they have already been approved by the ICC.', '“BREAKING: The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu,” reads one X post that had received more than 12,100 likes and shares as of Thursday.', 'Another X post, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, states: “Let me get this straight: the ICC just issued arrest warrants against Israeli officials, but has never issued an arrest warrant against say, Bashar al-Assad?! ICC is now completely illegitimate.”', 'But no warrants have been issued.', 'Khan said on Monday that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant and three Hamas leaders — Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — who he believes are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. This means that a panel of three judges will now decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow the case to proceed.', 'The judges typically take two months to make such decisions. A warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, for example, was issued in March 2023 after nearly a month of deliberations. Ousted Sudanese autocrat Omar al-Bashir faced his first of two ICC warrants eight months after it was requested. Neither has been arrested.', 'Israel is not a member of the ICC, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution, The Associated Press has reported. But the threat of arrest could make it difficult for the Israeli leaders to travel abroad.', 'Netanyahu called Khan’s move a “disgrace” and accused the prosecution of antisemitism, vowing to press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas militants. Hamas has also denounced the ICC prosecutor’s request to arrest its leaders, saying it “equates the victim with the executioner.”', 'The ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the world’s most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The U.N. General Assembly endorsed the ICC, but the court is independent. Dozens of countries don’t accept the court’s jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and other crimes. They include Israel, the United States, Russia and China.', 'Israel is also facing a South African case in the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s top court, accusing Israel of genocide. It denies those charges.', 'Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck",

', 'The Diamondbacks intentionally walked Seager with two outs and an open base in the third after the Rangers had taken a 1-0 lead on Jonah Heim’s RBI double. When Seager came up with a runner on and two outs in the fifth, the World Series MVP lined the first pitch he saw into the right-field seats to make it 4-0.', 'That was pretty much a replay of the series opener Tuesday night, when Seager was given a free pass with two outs in the third, then hit a go-ahead three-run homer in the fifth for the final runs in a 4-2 victory.

        "article": "GRINDAVIK, Iceland (AP) — A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted Wednesday for the fifth time since December, spewing red lava that once again threatened the coastal town of Grindavik and led to the evacuation of the popular Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.', 'The eruption began in the early afternoon following a series of earthquakes north of the town of 3,800 people that was largely evacuated in December when the volcano came to life after centuries of dormancy and put on an impressive show of nature’s power.', 'Although activity began to calm down by early evening, the eruption was estimated to be the area’s most vigorous so far, as lava shot 50 meters (165 feet) into the sky from a fissure that grew to 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) in length, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said.', 'Barriers built to protect Grindavik deflected the flowing lava that cut off two of the three roads leading to town and was close to reaching the third.', '“It’s a much larger volume that’s on the move right now headed for town,” Grindavik Mayor Fannar Jónasson told national broadcaster RUV. “The lava has already conquered (a lot).”', 'Workers and anyone still in town were ordered to leave earlier in the day, police said. The Blue Lagoon thermal spa — one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions — was evacuated before the eruption began, RUV said.', 'At one point, a dark plume of ash boiled up over the crater from an explosive interaction of magma hitting groundwater, scientists said.', 'The cloud did not rise high enough to initially pose any threat to aviation, but scientists were closely monitoring the situation, Jóhanna Malen Skúladóttir, of the Met Office, told RUV.', 'Grindavik, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, has been threatened since a swarm of earthquakes in November forced an evacuation in advance of the initial Dec. 18 eruption. A subsequent eruption overwhelmed some defensive walls and consumed several buildings.', 'The area is part of the Svartsengi volcanic system that was dormant for nearly 800 years before reawakening. ', 'The volcano erupted again in February and March. The Feb. 8 eruption engulfed a pipeline, cutting off heat and hot water to thousands of people.', 'Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, sees regular eruptions and is experienced at dealing with them. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed huge clouds of ash into the atmosphere and led to widespread airspace closures over Europe.', 'Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed from London.",

        "article": "PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek played like the current No. 1 and the two-time defending champion at the French Open. No surprise there. That Naomi Osaka looked like the former No. 1 that she is — and on clay, no less — amounted to an announcement that she is still quite capable of elite tennis.', 'Surging down the stretch as Osaka faded, Swiatek saved a match point and grabbed the last five games to sneak her way to a 7-6 (1), 1-6, 7-5 victory in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday night in a thrill-a-minute contest befitting two women who both own four Grand Slam headings.', '“For sure, this match was really intense. Much more intense for the second round than I ever expected. For sure, I’ll be more ready next time,” Swiatek said. “Naomi played amazing tennis. … I’m happy that she’s back and she’s playing well.”', 'For Swiatek, this extended her Roland Garros winning streak to 16 matches as she pursues a third consecutive trophy at the clay-court major. For Osaka, who cried when she left the court after letting a 5-2 lead in the concluding set slip away, this amounted to a return to her big-hitting best.', 'They went back-and-forth for nearly three hours as rain loudly pelted the outside of the closed roof at Court Philippe Chatrier — showers forced the postponements of 23 singles matches until Thursday — and a riveted, if hardly full, crowd alternated their support between the two players. Sometimes, spectators called out before a point was done, prompting admonishment from chair umpire Aurélie Tourte during the match. And from Swiatek afterward.', '“Sometimes, under a lot of pressure, when you scream something during the rally or right before the return, it’s really, really hard to be focused,” Swiatek said. “The stakes are big and there is a lot of money here to win. So losing a few points may change a lot. So please, guys, if you can support us between the rallies but not during, that would be really, really amazing.”', 'Osaka served for the victory at 5-3 in the final set, and was a point away from winning, but she put a backhand into the net. Soon, when Osaka missed another backhand, this one long, Swiatek finally converted a break point on her 10th chance of that set, and they played on.', 'Maybe the lack of high-level matches caught up to Osaka, because her mistakes continued to mount, including a double-fault that put Swiatek in control 6-5. Swiatek, who has led the WTA rankings for nearly every week since April 2022, then held serve one last time.', '“I don’t necessarily feel like I regret anything,” Osaka said.', 'Still, this was, without a doubt, Osaka’s top performance since she returned to the tour in January after 15 months away while becoming a mother. (Her daughter, who is 10 months old now, accompanied Osaka to Paris and recently started walking.)', '“I was watching Iga win this tournament last year, and I was pregnant. It was just my dream to be able to play her,” Osaka said. “When I kind of think of it like that, I think I’m doing pretty well. And I’m also just trying not to be too hard on myself. I feel like I played her on her better surface. I’m a hard-court kid, so I would love to play her on my surface and see what happens.”', 'Because of the weather, only nine matches were completed Wednesday, and winners included Coco Gauff, Ons Jabeur, Sofia Kenin, Carlos Alcaraz, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev.', 'It’s been a few years since Osaka played this capably and confidently, hammering big serves at up to 122 mph (197 kph) and imposing groundstrokes. Her quick-strike capabilities were on full display: Osaka won 82 of the 139 points (59%) that lasted four strokes or fewer, and she finished with a 54-37 advantage in total winners.', 'All of those familiar mannerisms were back, too. She turned her back to Swiatek to reset between points, hopped in place, tugged at her pink visor’s brim and slapped her palm on her thigh. Osaka celebrated points by shaking a clenched fist and shouting “Come on!”', 'She grabbed nine of 10 games to dominate the second set and lead 3-0 in the third. Then 4-1. Then 5-2.', 'As one ball or another would fly past Swiatek, zipped near a corner or right at a line, she turned toward her guest box and shot a look of confusion or concern in the direction of her coach and her sports psychologist.', '“I felt for most of the match that I wasn’t really (in the) here and now,” Swiatek said. “My mind was, like, playing around sometimes.”', 'She’s not used to this sort of one-way traffic coming head-on in her direction. Normally, it’s Swiatek who is delivering lopsided sets at a foe’s expense, especially on clay. She now has won her last 14 matches this month, with headings on the surface at Madrid and Rome — a clay double no woman had done since Serena Williams in 2013.', 'But this marked a sudden return to the Osaka everyone came to expect, match in and match out, back when she was at the height of her powers, climbing atop the rankings and gathering two trophies apiece at the U.S. Open and Australian Open from late 2018 to early 2021.', 'It was in May 2021 that Osaka withdrew from the French Open before her second-round match, explaining that she experiences “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking to the media and revealing she had dealt with depression. She took time away from the tour for a mental health break, then opted for another hiatus after her heading defense at the U.S. Open a few months later ended with a third-round loss.', 'She helped usher in a change in the way athletes, sports fans and society at large understood the importance of mental health — and prompted those in charge of various sports, including tennis, to take the issue seriously and try to accommodate and protect them better.', 'Osaka entered with an 0-4 record on the red stuff against opponents ranked in the top 10 and never has been past the third round at Roland Garros. This also would have been her first win anywhere against a top-10 opponent since January 2020.', 'Instead, though, it is Swiatek who moves on and continues her bid to become the first woman with three championships in a row in Paris since Justine Henin in 2007-09.', 'AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "article": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Months after the nation’s capital bid an emotional farewell to its giant pandas, the National Zoo is expecting a renewed surge in panda-mania with the announcement that two more of the furry black-and-white icons will be coming to Washington. ', 'The zoo announced Wednesday that a fresh agreement had been struck with the Chinese government, and a pair of adult pandas would be arriving from China by the end of the year. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute said the incoming pair are Bao Li (pronounced BOW’-lee) and Qing Bao (ching-BOW’). ', '“We’re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, D.C.,” said Brandie Smith, the zoo’s director. “This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact.”', 'Giant pandas are prized in Washington and around the nation and the world. The number of pandas in American zoos has dwindled as loan agreements lapsed during diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China that remain high. Washington’s three pandas returned to China last November. ', 'Word of the new exchange agreement spread quickly through the National Zoo grounds Wednesday, with multiple signs announcing “The Pandas Are Coming!” and fresh displays of panda-themed merchandise holding a prominent place in the gift shops. ', 'Sofia Valle, an 8th grader from Bear, Delaware, came with a school group hoping to see pandas and unaware that the zoo is currently panda-free. Instead she and her classmates — all wearing panda-ear headbands — posed for pictures in front of a Giant Panda statue and discussed coming back after the new bears arrive.', '“They’re my favorite animal,” Valle said. “They’re so fluffy! And they’re lazy like me.”', 'Panda fever also means business for the area around the zoo. At Baked By Yael, a bakery across the street from one of the main entrances, panda-themed cake pops and T-shirts never stopped selling, even after the bears had left.', '“We are super super excited,” said owner Yael Krigman. “Honestly, we never gave up faith. We knew they were going to come back eventually.”', 'When they arrive, the pandas will spend several weeks in quarantine with limited human contact as zoo staffers work to acclimate them to their new environment.', '“This is huge. I can’t wait. It couldn’t have come any sooner,” said Mariel Lally, one of the zoo’s panda keepers. “Pandas are such an incredible species.”', 'Chinese President Xi Jinping had signaled during a trip in late 2023 that China would be sending new pandas to the United States. He called them “envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.”', 'The zoo accompanied the announcement with a light-hearted video featuring Smith, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III and first lady Jill Biden. The trio in the video are gathered to discuss protocol for a reception to welcome unnamed honored guests. When Biden asks about attire and menu, Smith dryly replies that the impending guests are “strict vegetarians” who are “partial to black and white.” ', 'AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the nation’s capital will again host iconic guests from China.', 'Last November, giant pandas Tian Tian and Mei Xiang and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, went back to China, prompting a nationwide outpouring of farewell from millions of U.S. panda fans of all ages. The trio’s departure left only one panda family remaining in American zoos, at Zoo Atlanta, and those remain scheduled to return to China later this year. ', 'Zoo Atlanta is making preparations to return panda parents Lun Lun and Yang Yang along with their American-born twins Ya Lun and Xi Lun, zoo officials said earlier this month.', 'It’s possible that America will welcome another new panda pair before the Atlanta bears depart. The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer. A separate agreement was also announced to send a breeding pair of pandas to San Francisco as well. ', 'Pandas have been a symbol of U.S.-China friendship since Beijing sent a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later, Beijing loaned pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back to panda conservation programs.', 'When U.S-China relations began to sour in recent years, members of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas. Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as China’s “national treasure,” flooded China’s social media.', 'The National Zoo said the pandas coming to Washington are:', '— Bao Li, a 2-year-old male whose name means “treasure” and “energetic.” He was born Aug. 4, 2021, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan to father An An and mother Bao Bao. The zoo said Bao Li’s mother was born at the zoo in 2013, and his grandparents Tian Tian and Mei Xiang lived at the zoo from 2000 to 2023. It was Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, along with their cub Xiao Qi Ji, who left the zoo in November.', '— Qing Bao, a 2-year-old female whose name means “green” and “treasure.” She was born Sept. 12, 2021.', 'A research and breeding agreement with the Chinese runs through April 2034 and, like previous ones, says any cubs born at the zoo will move to China by age 4, according to the announcement. The zoo will pay a $1 million annual fee to the China Wildlife Conservation Association to support research and conservation efforts in China.', 'AP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed to this article.",

        "article": "NEW YORK (AP) — After nearly two dozen witnesses, 16 days of testimony and hours of lawyers’ closing arguments, it’s time for the jurors to have their say in Donald Trump’s hush money trial.', 'Jury deliberations began Wednesday in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. The seven-man, five-woman panel is tasked with deciding whether Trump is guilty of any of 34 felony counts of falsifying his company’s records.', 'Prosecutors say Trump falsified the records to veil reimbursements to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, who had paid porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign not to air her claim that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier.', 'The former president and presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty, denies any sexual interaction with Daniels and argues that the payments to Cohen were correctly designated as legal expenses in company records. ', 'Now that the case has gone to the jury, here’s a look at how deliberations will work.', 'If the jury convicts Trump, it must unanimously find he created a false entry in his company’s records, or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of violating or concealing a violation of a state law making it illegal for conspirators “to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.”', 'A conviction would mean that jurors all agreed that something unlawful was done to promote Trump’s election. But they don’t have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was. In this case, jurors could choose between three possible unlawful acts:', '-- They could find that one of the conspirators broke the Federal Election Campaign Act, which in 2016 made it illegal for a person to give something worth more than $2,700 to a presidential campaign. It also banned corporations from contributing to a campaign.', '-- They could find that other business records were falsified, including federal tax forms that Trump’s company issued to Cohen, bank records associated with Cohen’s payment to Daniels, or an invoice used when the National Enquirer’s parent company paid Karen McDougal, a former model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, which he denied.', '-- They could find that false information was submitted on a tax return.', 'For a conviction, each juror would have to find that at least one of those unlawful things happened.', 'Behind closed doors in a room reserved for the jury. ', 'While the 12 deliberate, the six alternate jurors who have also observed the whole trial will be in a separate space in the courthouse. If a jury member is unable to continue because of illness or other reasons, an alternate juror will then take that person’s place, and deliberations will begin anew.', 'Jurors went into deliberations after getting detailed instructions on the relevant laws in the case, what must be proven in order for them to convict, and their duty to acquit if it’s not proven. They had to hand over their cellphones to court officers to hold. ', 'Very little. The deliberations are secret, though jurors — whose identities are being kept from the public — can have a court officer deliver notes from them to the judge. ', 'The first came about 3 1/2 hours into deliberations, when the jury asked to rehear some testimony from Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker. Then, while the attorneys and court were gathering that testimony, jurors sent a request to rehear Judge Juan M. Merchan’s instructions on the laws applicable to the case. ', 'Merchan read the jurors’ notes in court and discussed with prosecutors and defense lawyers how to respond. Then jurors were brought into court for a question from the judge: whether they wanted all of the legal instructions or just part. After explaining that they could answer by note, he sent them home for the evening. ', 'The rereading will begin Thursday morning and will be done aloud from the trial transcript. (Jurors don’t have the transcript in the jury room but do have a court laptop loaded with documents and other materials that were shown during the trial.)', 'Court-watchers sometimes speculate about what the articles of a note might imply about the deliberations, but there’s no way to know for sure. ', 'Jurors also send a note to signal when they have reached a verdict — or, sometimes, to say they’re bogged down. ', 'He doesn’t have to stay in the courtroom itself but must be in the building. During the trial, he and his attorneys and security personnel have had the use of a courtroom across the hall for breaks. ', 'As long as they need to. The standard court day runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a break for lunch (jurors’ meals will be delivered). But judges sometimes extend the hours if jurors wish. There’s no limit on how many days deliberations can continue. ', 'Yes, at the end of each court day. The jury isn’t sequestered, the legal term for isolating the panel from the outside world. That was once mandatory for many felony cases in New York state, but the requirement was lifted in 2001, and sequestration is now rare. ', 'Jurors will send a note, via a court officer, saying there is a verdict, but not what it is. The judge will summon Trump, his defense team and prosecutors back to the courtroom if they’re not there already, and then announce that the jury has reached a verdict. ', 'Then the jury will be brought in, and the foreperson — in New York, that job generally goes to the first juror chosen — will be asked whether the jury has reached a verdict. If the answer is yes, the foreperson will then be asked what the verdict is for each count and will answer either “guilty” or “not guilty.”', 'Then the jury likely will be asked collectively, “Is this your verdict?” Prosecutors or defense lawyers also can ask to have each juror asked the same question individually.', 'If jurors send a note saying they can’t agree, the judge, in consultation with both sides, must decide what to do next. Defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial. That could be granted, but often, the response is to call the jury in for some form of instruction to keep trying. ', 'Prosecutors and defense lawyers often debate what should be said. Judges may look to the New York court system’s sample language for what’s known as a “modified Allen charge.” It urges jurors to make every possible effort to reach a verdict, and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. ', 'If deadlock notes continue, the message may be repeated or tweaked. So, too, arguments for a mistrial. There’s no hard-and-fast rule about how long a jury must keep attempting to resolve differences before a mistrial can be declared. ",

She was eliminated on exactly the sort of “super short, tricky word” she said she concentrated on studying after misspelling “orle” last year. This year it was “varan,” a type of lizard.

        "heading": "‘The Defense Ministry is going through a cull’ How a war between Kremlin elite clans shaped Putin’s post-inauguration appointments ",
        "article": "In the last month, five high-ranking Russian military officials have been arrested on corruption charges in what amounts to an unprecedented purge, coinciding with the dismissal of longtime Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. Sources close to the Kremlin say that the Defense Ministry shake-up and Vladimir Putin’s post-inauguration personnel changes are largely the result of an “inter-clan war” among elites in President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. Meduza explains how these clans operate behind closed doors, how they influenced Putin’s government reshuffle, and whatclan dynamics can tell us aboutRussia’s future.', 'Two weeks before Vladimir Putin’s May 7 inauguration, Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov was arrested on suspicion of accepting more than $10 million worth of bribes in the form of construction services. Reportedly known as the “king of kickbacks” behind the scenes, Ivanov wasn’t exactly discreet about his dealings; he flaunted his extravagant lifestyle online, which eventually landed him the starring role ina 2022 investigatory video by Alexey Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.', 'But it’s not as if corruption within the Defense Ministry — or the entire Russian government for that matter — is a rarity. So why Ivanov and why now?', 'A bit more clarity came just two weeks later when Ivanov’s patron and boss, Sergey Shoigu, was removed from his position as defense minister as part of Putin’s post-inauguration personnel reshuffle. Overnight, Shoigu went from leading the ministry in charge of implementing Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine to overseeing the Security Council — an advisory body that lacks any power to make political decisions.', 'In the days and weeks that followed Shoigu’s departure, four more Defense Ministry officials — Lieutenant General Yuri Kuznetsov, Major General Ivan Popov, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, and procurement head Vladimir Verteletsky — met a fate similar to Ivanov’s and were arrested on corruption-related charges.', '“The Ministry of Defense is now going through a cull,” Stephen Hall, an assistant professor of Russian politics at the University of Bath, told Meduza. “And a lot of these people who were linked to Shoigu have been charged with corruption.”', 'Indeed, in less than six weeks, six high-ranking Defense Ministry officials have fallen from grace. And according to multiple Russian politics experts who spoke to Meduza, this significant shake-up is largely the result of an “inter-clan war” within Putin’s inner circle.', 'Contrary to the pervasive myth that Russia is run by Putin alone, what truly drives the political and economic machinery in Russia today is competition between “clans,” or factions of government officials and/or business magnates.', 'Since the early 2000s, clans have consolidated around elites like former Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov, former Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev (now a presidential aide), and Putin’s purported “personal banker” and longtime friend Yuri Kovalchuk. Each of these clan leaders has built up an extensive patron-client network of cronies whose government or corporate appointments and access to plundered state assets depend not on merit but on personal loyalty.', 'The rules of the game in this informal system are quite simple: clan leaders who gain access to Putin’s ear and stay in his good graces are rewarded with managerial control over institutions like state-owned enterprises, security agencies, and government ministries that manage the country’s most lucrative assets. In turn, clan leaders distribute access to those assets amongst their own patron-client networks — for the guarantee of a kickback, of course — to bolster their own loyal power bases.', 'Hall describes Putin’s role in this corrupt bargain as the arbitrator, balancing clan interests to ensure no single clan gains enough power to eventually jeopardize his own. Timur Ivanov’s arrest, however, threatened to throw this equilibrium into disarray.', 'Timur Ivanov wasn’t just a close protégé of Shoigu. According to experts like Hall, Ivanov was the Shoigu clan’s “wallet”: the figure responsible for keeping Shoigu’s riches safe and ensuring they’re “stuck away” in a tax haven somewhere.', '“Generally, there had been an unwritten gentleman’s agreement that you didn’t go after [‘wallets’ like Ivanov],” Hall told Meduza. “[Because] if you went after them, they might decide to spill the beans about what their clan has been doing. It would also highlight quite how corrupt and kleptocratic the regime actually is.”', 'To be sure, the Defense Ministry’s deep-rooted corruption under Shoigu isn’t the only stain on the former defense minister’s record that likely factored into his reassignment. He is credited as being one of the staunchest advocates of launching Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, promising Putin a quick victory — something that clearly didn’t go according to plan. As the war dragged on, Kremlin insiders and pro-war bloggers increasingly laid responsibility for the war’s hefty economic and human costs at Shoigu’s feet.', 'This criticism reached a boiling point in June 2023, when Wagner Group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin publicly accused Shoigu and the head of the Russian Army’s General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, of gross incompetence and intentionally deceiving Putin and the Russian public about the state of the war. Although that standoff largely resolved itself after Prigozhin’s failed August 2023 mutiny and subsequent “mysterious” death, Shoigu’s rivals smelled blood in the water. Against this backdrop, Meduza’s Andrey Pertsev argues that Ivanov’s arrest can be seen as the first strike in a larger battle to topple Shoigu and attenuate his clan’s influence in the Kremlin.', 'The list of figures who had plausible motives for undermining Shoigu’s clan isn’t exactly short — there are many elites who would have stood to benefit from his ouster from the Defense Ministry. Nonetheless, one clan of elites embedded in Russia’s military-industrial complex stands out both for its long-term efforts to remove Shoigu from power and its public interactions with him following Ivanov’s arrest.', 'The key figure in this clan is a former KGB officer who worked with Putin back in his Dresden days — Sergey Chemezov. Since the early 2000s, Chemezov has overseen Russia’s key exports in the military-industrial sector, first as the CEO of Russian state-owned arms seller Rosoboronexport, and then in his current position as the CEO of Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec. Over the years, Chemezov’s influence in Russia’s military-defense complex has helped neutralize the ambitions of Defense Ministry officials like Shoigu, who might seek to monopolize the ministry’s assets and use those spoils to accrue political power. Another staunch Shoigu rival and prominent figure in Chemezov’s clan is Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia’s National Guard (Rosgvardiya). Zolotov had long endeavored to extend his influence over the Defense Ministry by lobbying for members of his own clan to replace Shoigu as defense minister.', 'Evidence of this inter-clan rivalry previously surfaced in a leaked April 2023 phone call, in which a Russian billionaire and a former senator discussed how Chemezov, Zolotov, and Rosneft head Igor Sechin had “teamed up” to “tear [Shoigu] the fuck down.”', 'Sources close to Putin’s administration believe it was this inter-clan conflict that ultimately became the deciding factor in Shoigu’s May 12 dismissal. After months of complaining privately to Putin that the defense industry’s slow weapons deliveries were to blame for the Russian army’s measly territorial gains in Ukraine, Shoigu brought this conflict into the public eye — a big faux pas in Kremlin infighting etiquette.', 'Even though we’re outlawed in Russia, we continue to deliver exclusive reporting and analysis from inside the country.', 'Our journalists on the ground take risks to keep you informed about changes in Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.SupportMeduza’s work today.', 'During a Joint Group of Forces meeting on May 1, Shoigu ordered the defense industry to increase the quantity and quality of weapons production, intimating that the army’s success — or failure — depended on it. Because Rostec is the army’s largest defense contractor, Chemezov was none too pleased with Shoigu’s apparent effort to deflect responsibility onto him. That same night, a Russian politics Telegram channel cited government insiders as saying that Shoigu, in reference to Ivanov’s arrest, had accused Rostec (and, by extension, Chemezov), Chemezov ally and then-Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, and Russian Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev of “creating additional difficulties and interfering with the [army’s] plans.”', 'But Shoigu’s dismissal wasn’t quite the victory that the Chemezov clan had in mind. Firstly, the Chemezov clan’s ultimate goal was to replace Shoigu with one of their own, not simply to remove him from the Defense Ministry. Instead, Putin replaced Shoigu with Andrey Belousov, a Putin loyalist who doesn’t belong to any clan, thus denying the Chemezov clan an opportunity to make inroads into the Defense Ministry.', 'Secondly, although the Chemezov clan’s efforts likely influenced Putin’s decision to remove Shoigu, they by no means forced Putin’s hand. Shoigu’s dismissal ultimately served a strategic purpose for Putin: many began to attribute the army’s failure to achieve a speedy victory in Ukraine to Shoigu’s Defense Ministry, not least because of its reputation as a breeding ground for corruption. In this sense, cleaning house in the Defense Ministry signals to the public that Putin is serious about both cracking down on corruption and putting Russia on a clear path to victory in Ukraine.', 'Putin’s appointment of a technocrat economist as defense minister only further amplifies this message. As Hall notes: “[Putin] can’t afford to lose this war. And Belousov is going to be the man who [can] potentially reform the Ministry of Defense — if it can be reformed — to sufficiently continue this war for a while.”', 'Another key switch-up that came from Putin’s post-inauguration appointments was Nikolai Patrushev’s transition from leading the Security Council — the position now occupied by Sergey Shoigu — to overseeing shipbuilding as one of Putin’s aides. Patrushev has amassed a significant power base of elites within Russia’s security services since climbing the ranks of the KGB in the 1970s. However, because the makeup of Patrushev’s clan has ebbed and flowed over the years, which has resulted in more conditional alliances than long-lasting ones, many are left wondering if Patrushev’s new position might indicate that his clan’s influence is fading.', 'On paper, Patrushev’s new role is certainly a demotion. However, Hall doesn’t find much merit in dissecting the semantics of official job headings and descriptions. “Yes, he’s been moved from the Security Council,” he told Meduza. “But he’s still going to be close to Putin. He’ll still see him relatively often, if not every day. So, I think for Patrushev […] maybe [it’s a demotion], but he still has access to the Tsar, and that, ultimately, is the important thing for him.” Hall also suggested the move might have been a more pragmatic play by Putin: “They’re moving him because it’s a way to get access to new information, which is important for any autocracy in order to adapt.”', 'But even if Putin’s intention was to limit Patrushev’s power, his clan moved up in the “power vertical” through another member’s appointment as Deputy Prime Minister of Agriculture: Dmitry Patrushev, Nikolai Patrushev’s son.', 'Dmitry Patrushev is one of several “princes” — men with familial connections to Putin and his inner circle — to have received government postings since Putin’s fifth inauguration in early May. Putin’s relative, Sergey Tsivilev, and Boris Kovalchuk —whose father, Yuri Kovalchuk, has been called the second-most powerful person in Russia and leads the banking and media asset-rich Kovalchuk clan — have also secured prominent appointments as the chairman of the Accounts Chamber and energy minister, respectively.', 'Putin’s decision to dole out key positions to the most powerful elites’ offspring not only harks back to Russia’s imperial era, as journalist Mikhail Zygarrecently argued, but also hints at how Putin might be preparing for his eventual exit from power. Hall suggested that the appointments might be a kind of trial run for the young princes, adding that “the inner circle is, to an extent, perpetuating itself.” “It’s now passing its wealth and its control to its future generations.”', 'Against the backdrop of the inter-clan conflicts, the princes’ appointments also serve to hamper any sentiments of disloyalty or overreach within Putin’s inner circle. The Patrushev and Kovalchuk clans are particularly incentivized to play by the rules now that their princes’ stars are on the rise. As for Putin, he can sit back and resume his role as the main arbiter of clan interests while the princes and their respective clans compete to prove their loyalty as much as their competency.', 'Sergey Shoigu’s departure from the Defense Ministry — along with the arrests of five high-up Defense Ministry officials — appears to be the most salient change in the recent Kremlin shake-up.', 'Although Shoigu’s new position as Security Council secretary is still considered a coveted role within the government, it’s most certainly a demotion for the former Defense Minister. In his new role, Shoigu has a drastically smaller staff than before and lacks any enforcement authority. Most importantly for Shoigu’s clan, the Defense Ministry is no longer their cash cow: “Because he’s been moved to the Security Council, there’s less money to be made now,” Hall noted. “So that will be very hard for him in terms of how to keep his side happy.”', 'But despite his own clan’s recent misfortunes, analysts also consider Shoigu to be a key ally to Yuri Kovalchuk’s clan — a factor that could potentially soften the blow against the former defense minister. Many in the Kovalchuk clan fared well in the reshuffle, including Chairman of the Accounts Chamber “prince” Boris Kovalchuk, First Deputy Chief of Staff Sergey Kiriyenko, and Mikhail Mishustin, who held onto his position as prime minister.', 'As for the Chemezov clan, although its members succeeded in removing Shoigu from the Defense Ministry, their efforts to install one of their own in his place proved unsuccessful. Nonetheless, the Chemezov clan still has a high profile in the Kremlin: Rosgvardiya head Viktor Zolotov maintains close proximity to Putin, and two Chemezov allies, recently appointed First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov and presidential aide Alexey Dyumin, were given prominent roles in the reshuffle.', 'Dyumin is also thought to be close to the Patrushev clan, so his recent promotion also plays well for Patrushev. What’s more, Patrushev’s “prince,” Dmitry Patrushev, has been elevated to a deputy prime minister position, and, while some interpret Patrushev’s new role as a clear demotion, he still has Putin’s ear.', 'Despite each clan endeavoring to tip the scales in its favor, Putin selectively rearranged his cabinet to ensure that no single clan achieved a relative victory over another.', 'Putin has long been averse to change when it comes to the makeup of his inner circle and those at the top of his “power vertical.” Rather than refreshing his ranks with those who might prove more capable at effectively governing, he opts to keep his most-trusted allies in power — even if it means sending them to less-prestigious roles, as he did with Shoigu, and bloating his cabinet with newly crafted positions, like he did with Dyumin. Such an arrangement, after all, has allowed him to preside over a thriving kleptocracy, insured by his ability to balance clan interests and their deeply entrenched patron-client networks. So, Putin’s decision to counterbalance the feuding clans through cabinet appointments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise since providing any one clan with too much power risks threatening his own.', 'However, Putin’s conservative modus operandi for personnel selection only serves to exacerbate any future succession conflicts that may arise when the curtain finally falls on him. His power vertical has grown ever more top-heavy since his recent appointments, and, although he might be dangling a few carrots in front of the Patrushev and Kovalchuk princes, Putin continues to obfuscate any indication of who he believes should become his successor.', 'Clans that had been eyeing the throne in anticipation of Putin’s expected 2024 departure were already forced to shift their timelines in 2021 when Putin rewrote the constitution, allowing him to remain in office until 2036. Putin’s continued insistence on balancing clan interests and playing his retirement cards close to the chest — especially as clans become ever more emboldened, breaking unspoken rules like going after another clan’s “wallet” — suggests that the inter-clan fighting within the Kremlin might just be a hint at what’s to come.', 'A digest of Russia’s investigative reports and news analysis.

        "article": "On Wednesday, Russian YouTuber Yuri Dud released a lengthy interview with exiled former oligarch turned opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky. During the nearly three-hour conversation, Khodorkovsky discussed the 1990s and its political figures, the rumored negotiations for Alexey Navalny’s release in a prisoner swap, and Yevgeny Prigozhin’s ill-fated mutiny. Meduza shares some notable excerpts from the interview.', 'I suggested helping him reach Moscow. I think that besides the regime coming to its natural end, there could be a situation where the elites become divided. Then, the elites split because of relative failures on the front. [Even] if we get lucky again and this elite begins to fracture, it won’t split into good and bad — it will split into bad and very bad. We must take advantage of this division in order to bring this regime to an end sooner than it would naturally die. […]', '[Prigozhin] was an enemy who could weaken the other enemy. […] If there’s an enemy ready to clash with another enemy of mine and potentially weaken him so much that he loses his power and the war ends sooner, I’ll turn a blind eye to anything. This doesn’t mean that I’d sit down for tea with Prigozhin later. It means that you need to deal with the stronger enemy before you deal with the weaker one. That’s the only way to win such battles. […]', 'When there’s a war, you shoot. Unfortunately, this inevitably leads to some innocent casualties. Still, you keep shooting, because it’s the only way to win.

There’s always that chance. But should we just sit on our hands and do nothing because our missile might go off course? Prigozhin was this kind of missile. […]', 'Had Prigozhin reached the Oka River, Putin would have had to withdraw troops from Moscow, leaving it defenseless from a security standpoint. At that moment, if we managed to mobilize 20,000 to 30,000 people to seize government buildings, then, as you know — and I know this for sure from the experiences of 1991 and 1993 — whoever captures the Kremlin captures power in the country. This was a very real possibility. Don’t tell me that this missile [Prigozhin’s mutiny] was definitely off course. It didn’t reach its target, unfortunately.', 'This was a situation where everyone needed to call people to the streets. That’s why the opposition needs to develop the habit of working together. Because in this situation the opposition, acting together, could have won. This was a real chance. And if such a chance arises, and if any brute is part of that chance, I will use and urge others to use that person so that ultimately both brutes are eliminated.', 'To date, I’ve learned two things, which were confirmed by all the people I dealt with, both on the American and the German side. There was a request to exchange [Vadim] Krasikov for [Alexey] Navalny — both from my side and from the FBK [Anti-Corruption Foundation]. However, even the German side hadn’t made a decision on the matter. Based on what I was told, the German Foreign Ministry was opposed to exchanging Krasikov for Navalny. I don’t know whether this is true or not. That’s what I was told, and I’m now sharing it. Discussions about this [exchange] weren’t held with the Russian side.', 'What I was told from the Russian side came from people associated with Roman Abramovich who, in various iterations, conveyed exactly what Vladimir Putin later confirmed. My personal impression is that Putin was not only playing his own game, pretending to be a humanitarian, but also giving additional legitimacy to Abramovich, whom he needs for his games with peace negotiations, which Putin uses at various times to spread disinformation and reduce the willingness of some Western countries to supply weapons to Ukraine. I’m not sure [negotiations about exchanging Navalny] were in the form that Putin describes. But I know for sure that neither the Germans nor the Americans came forward with a concrete proposal.', 'The time when [Surkov and I] worked together was good. It’s hard for me to accept what he did while working for Putin. But that’s the kind of person he is — he chooses a master and then serves that master. You can ask him to answer for what he does, but his psyche is such that you need to hold his master accountable because it’s pointless to hold him responsible. He’ll do exactly what he’s told to and do it very professionally.', 'At the same time, he remained a relatively decent person in personal relationships, even when I was in prison. And believe me, there weren’t many government officials at that time who were willing to touch anything associated with me, even peripherally. Surkov, on Putin’s orders, relentlessly attacked me using propaganda. A huge number of myths circulating today, including the myth that I proposed selling Russia’s nuclear capability to the Americans, were all fabricated by Surkov. Yet, at the same time, when my wife had a problem with our children (they were forced out of school), the only person she could turn to and who resolved the issue was Surkov.', 'For my generation, it was natural that we had no role in appointing the head of state. We all understood when we went to the polls that these weren’t real elections. In the Soviet Union, everyone understood this perfectly. For me, it was natural that there was a person who somehow ended up in power without any involvement from me, and I coexisted with this person. This person could be a benevolent tsar, or a cruel tsar, or not a tsar at all. Yeltsin was a great tsar, both magnanimous and very tough, and deeply reverent towards his power. And in all other respects, he was generous and didn’t bother with trifles. So when people tell me that an apartment or some money mattered to him, well, it’s completely inconsistent with the Yeltsin I knew. He didn’t give a damn about any of that. But power — that he did give a damn about.', 'We were staying at the same hotel [in Davos in 1996]. He came to see me in the evening, said we should sit and have a drink. Well, we did. He said: “[Mr. Khodorkovsky], we really respect you. We really need industry leaders like you. You’ll definitely stay as general director, no doubt about it. But it’s clear the property will have to be returned.” We talked generally about his plans. At that moment, he was confident he’d win [in the 1996 Russian presidential elections].', 'When I listened to him, it was just a catastrophe. Picture a school teacher with all the typical beliefs of a school teacher. A wonderful person, but with absolutely no connection to the industry he was planning to lead. No experience in the state-building he planned to undertake. I thought to myself with horror: “We already went through this once in 1991, when we transitioned from the Soviet Union to Russia — it was a catastrophe then, and now a second time? Never, God forbid it.” And that was it, I went up to Boris [Berezovsky] and said, “[Mr. Berezovsky], we need to do something.” […]', 'I never said that Zyuganov could bring back the Soviet Union. If Zyuganov could have brought back the Soviet Union, he would’ve been the president of Russia. He could’ve ruined what had started to gradually take shape by then yet again, at yet another stage. He could have destroyed Russia due to his inability to govern it. He could have destroyed industry and caused the next crisis, resulting in a dictator possibly coming to power.', 'I was deeply upset by the attitude [displayed by the filmmakers] toward the era, toward Boris [Yeltsin]. I understand everything about him. Maybe even more than you do. For me, [Yeltsin] is not only a tsar, he’s the person who, in many ways, gave everyone, including me, the freedom that [Mikhail] Gorbachev either didn’t want to or couldn’t give. [Yeltsin] was also a battle commander. He was a person with whom I risked my life. And purely psychologically, it turns out that it’s extremely difficult to get over that, even now. I snapped. Simply because the memory of risks we took together and the shared anticipation of prison or death suddenly triggered me, even 30 years later. […]', 'I understand all this, I reflect on it, I evaluate it. In some places, you and I see things similarly; in some, we see them differently. But on an emotional level, it turns out, no. On an emotional level, it’s hard for me, so I stand up for Yeltsin immediately and without thinking, and I start thinking later.', 'I was a private individual who made a private decision that Zyuganov wasn’t [an acceptable candidate] to me. I spent my personal money and the time of the people who worked with me to prevent Zyuganov from coming to power. I didn’t bribe voters or falsify ballots, and I wasn’t a government official for whom the type of work I did would have been inappropriate. I did everything that was possible and necessary at that moment. I don’t approve of what Yeltsin’s presidential administration did during that election campaign at the state’s expense and using state resources. But, sorry, what issues can you have with me on this point? I was a private individual. […]', 'I won’t accept any criticism related to the 1996 elections, simply because I wasn’t involved in them. I might accept criticism to the extent that I wasn’t as involved as I should have been. I should have actually stopped focusing on business and gotten involved in the elections, tried to push the balance we’d convinced Yeltsin to shift — from a state of emergency toward elections — even further toward more or less democratic elections because we’d have beaten Zyuganov regardless.",

        "heading": "Post-war problems Journalist Konstantin Skorkin on the key stumbling blocks for rebuilding Ukraine — and why money isn’t the biggest one",
        "article": "With Russia’s full-scale invasion now in its third year, destruction and reconstruction are still proceeding simultaneously in Ukraine. Be that as it may, Kyiv has been laying out big plans for the country’s post-war recovery, which will require more than just international investment. In an article originally written for Kit, journalist and researcher Konstantin Skorkin looks to the future and examines the key stumbling blocks for rebuilding Ukraine that are already emerging through the fog of war. The following translation has been abridged for length and clarity.', 'Even if Russia’s invasion ended today, according to the most conservative estimates, Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery would cost around $500 billion and take at least 10 years. Kyiv has already taken the first steps on this long road, establishing a dedicated office for assessing the full extent of the damage, laying out a recovery plan, and securing tens of billions of dollars in international support for reconstruction.', 'According to Bloomberg, Ukraine’s reconstruction could be “the biggest investment opportunity since at least World War II.” And companies worldwide are already jockeying for their piece of the pie.', 'But rebuilding Ukraine will take more than cash. The war has dealt a terrible blow to the country’s human capital, from lives lost on the battlefield to civilians forced to flee abroad, many never to return. And bringing large numbers of people back to Ukraine is much harder than securing large amounts of funding.', 'Russia’s aggression has caused more than $150 billion in direct damage to Ukraine. The country’s GDP fell by 30 percent in 2022 and grew only 5 percent in 2023. The World Bank estimates the cost of reconstruction and recovery at $486 billion, while European Investment Bank chief Werner Hoyer predicts that Ukraine may require as much as $1.1 trillion in outside assistance to rebuild.', 'Ukraine’s main export sectors, agriculture and metallurgy, have been hit especially hard. According to estimates from the Kyiv School of Economics, the agricultural sector has suffered more than $80 billion in damages and losses, with Russia occupying fertile areas in Ukraine’s south and east, and shelling and landmines rendering farmland in the north unusable. Ukraine’s richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov, has seen his agricultural holding HarvEast lose 70 percent of its arable land to Russian occupation. And one of Ukraine’s leading grain exporters, Nibulon, estimates its losses due to the war at more than $400 million. A Russian missile strike killed the company’s founder, grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadatursky, in July 2022.', 'The Ukrainian steel industry, meanwhile, has seen two of its biggest producers turned to rubble: the Azovstal and the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works in occupied Mariupol. These two factories, which once accounted for 40 percent of Ukraine’s steel production, made up the core of Akhmetov’s Metinvest Group. In June 2023, the company estimated its total damages from the war at more than $3.5 billion. Two other major steelworks — Akhmetov’s Zaporizhstal and ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih (formerly Kryvorizhstal) — are operating at half capacity, while the Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant, located in the Dnipropetrovsk region, has suspended work altogether.', 'Ukraine’s energy sector is also suffering, mainly due to sustained Russian attacks on its power plants. Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had destroyed “almost all” of Ukraine’s thermal power generation. And since Ukraine’s green energy infrastructure is concentrated in the south, Russian occupation has knocked out of commission 90 percent of its wind energy and half its solar power.', 'For Ukrainians, the damage to power plants and the electric grid means living with rolling power and heating outages. Moreover, repaired energy infrastructure risks getting hit again — like Kharkiv’s Thermal Power Plant No. 5. After being damaged in a missile strike in September 2022, the power plant came back online this March only to suffer a devastating attack two weeks later. Repair work is expected to take at least a year.', 'The Ukrainian authorities estimate that the country will need about $15 billion for immediate reconstruction and recovery efforts in 2024 alone. And Kyiv’s post-war Recovery Plan will require $750 billion over 10 years. Two-thirds of this funding is expected to come from Ukraine’s partners, with the remainder from private investors and confiscated assets from Russia and Russian oligarchs.', 'In July 2022, 40 countries signed the Lugano Declaration, pledging to support Ukraine’s post-war recovery. According to Bloomberg, the European Union plans to “contribute the bulk” of this financial assistance, which could exceed 500 billion euros ($523 billion). E.U. countries are also kicking in individually: Finland’s Ukraine Investment Facility, for example, plans to fund 50 million euros ($54 million) worth of projects in 2025–2026. Other European countries — including Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and Germany — have committed to helping rebuild specific Ukrainian regions.', 'The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided more than $23 billion in humanitarian, economic, and development assistance to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. Private companies are investing in Ukraine’s reconstruction, as well. In January, Kyiv announced that it was creating a Ukraine reconstruction bank with help from JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock. At the time, Zelensky’s deputy chief of staff Rostyslav Shurma said the fund could launch in five or six months with close to $1 billion in committed capital.', 'Theoretically, reparations and confiscated assets from Russia could also be important in rebuilding Ukraine. However, this is easier said than done. The former will hinge on when (and, more importantly, how) the war ends, while the latter is the subject of ongoing policy debate. Western countries have frozen around $300 billion in sovereign Russian assets since February 2022. The U.S. is still developing legislation that would allow for seizing the $5–$8 billion under its jurisdiction, while the E.U. greenlit using the profits from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine just this week.', 'The war has dealt perhaps the most terrible blow of all to Ukraine’s human potential. On top of causing tens of thousands of military and civilian losses, Russia’s invasion prompted one of the 21st century’s largest refugee waves. According to the United Nations, more than 6.4 million people have left Ukraine since February 2022. Some were forced to flee to Russia, but most found refuge in Europe.', 'More than two years on, many of these refugees have adapted to life in another country, and a significant proportion don’t plan to return home. A recent study by the U.N. Refugee Agency found that in the last year, the number of refugees who hope to go back to Ukraine has dropped from 77 percent to 65 percent. According to data from the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy, between 1.3 million and 3.3 million Ukrainians may not return to Ukraine.', 'With the war still ongoing, European countries continue to extend temporary asylum to Ukrainian refugees, and governments faced with labor shortages are encouraging Ukrainians to integrate into their countries’ labor markets. (That said, some countries — such as Norway and Finland — have decided to provide one-time payments to Ukrainians who want to return home.)', 'Then there’s the acute problem of displacement within Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has counted nearly five million internally displaced persons (IDPs). The aforementioned U.N. study found that 15 percent of Ukrainian IDPs have no intention or hope of returning to their former places of residence. For some, there’s nothing to return to: cities in the Donbas region like Bakhmut, Maryinka, and Avdiivka have been practically wiped off the map.', 'In interviews for this article, three internally displaced Ukrainians complained about a lack of affordable housing and about difficulties obtaining compensation for their destroyed homes. For those whose homes are located in Russia-occupied territories, there’s no compensation available at all. Social support for IDPs is also minimal, with payments ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 hryvnias ($50 to $75) per month. The government also tightened eligibility for IDP benefits as of March 1.', 'The displaced Ukrainians said they receive a lot of help from the U.N., UNICEF, and European charities. Since 2023, the E.U. has financed a special program aimed at converting existing buildings in 10 Ukrainian cities into housing facilities for IDPs. However, the Kyiv-based Rating Group found that 60 percent of Ukrainians surveyed consider the restoration of jobs and businesses more important than direct financial support.', 'The Rating Group poll also shows that opinions on reconstruction vary by region. For example, residents of western and central Ukraine are more supportive of postponing reconstruction until the war ends, whereas those living in eastern regions are more likely to support rebuilding as soon as possible.', 'Divisions such as these create additional tensions in society, which could, in turn, hinder Ukraine’s recovery. According to Rating Group’s director Oleksii Antypovych, a number of dividing lines have already begun to emerge, including between those who stayed (IDPs and the non-displaced), those who fled abroad, those who served in the army, and those who lost loved ones. “I think the biggest divisions are between those who are absorbed in the war \\xad— the mobilized and their families, people who lost their loved ones, residents of frontline territories — and those Ukrainians who are still trying to live a normal life,” sociologist Inna Volosevych told Politico earlier this year.', 'At the same time, Kyiv International Institute of Sociology director Volodymyr Paniotto notes that people are far more aggressive in their opinions on social media than in real life. For example, KIIS found that nearly 90 percent of those surveyed in Ukraine bear no ill will towards Ukrainian refugees currently abroad.', 'One way or another, Ukraine is on the verge of a demographic catastrophe. Polish political analyst Jadwiga Rogoża notes that current forecasts for Ukraine’s future population range from 24 to 35 million (compared to 48.5 million in 2001). Ukraine’s own Ministry of Social Policy estimates that the population could drop to 25 million by the end of 2050. What’s more, Ukraine is projected to have one of Europe’s oldest populations by 2030, since so many young people are leaving the country or dying at the front.', 'As Rogoża explains, the dynamics of Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction and economic development will depend on not only the level of spending on reconstruction but also the size, age, and health of the country’s population. “The slow and uneven reconstruction process may leave the map of Ukraine dotted with numerous ‘ghost towns’ — half-ruined places with no prospects for work and development,” she warns.', 'To get an idea of Ukraine’s potential post-war trajectory, it’s worth looking at the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s, which are perhaps the closest example of a major armed conflict in recent European history comparable to the war in Ukraine.', 'The wars that followed Yugoslavia’s collapse displaced around 3.7 million people in the 1990s, 700,000 of whom received temporary asylum in Germany. By 2000, 75 percent of these refugees had returned to their home country or another part of former Yugsolavia; another 15 percent settled in third countries and only 10 percent remained in Germany.', 'However, the return of these refugees didn’t solve the demographic problems facing the Balkan countries, which were in a state of post-war devastation. “Migration flows only grew stronger after the war,” says Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “One of the reasons [for this was] tighter European integration; the war-torn countries of the Western Balkans simply couldn’t compete with Europe in terms of attractiveness for living.”', 'Further rapprochement between Ukraine and the European Union, and the experiences of Ukrainian refugees living in the bloc, could produce similar results: many Ukrainians may very well prefer life in E.U. countries to the instability of post-war Ukraine.', 'For now, martial law remains a restraining factor on emigration. Ukraine’s borders have been closed to military-age men for more than two years, so 80 percent of Ukrainian refugees are women and children. Once martial law is lifted, however, many men will reunite with their families abroad and may even choose to stay there.', 'As Alfred Kammer, the director of the International Monetary Fund’s European Department, has pointed out, Ukraine’s economic recovery will depend on a number of factors, including how many people return to the country and their home regions in the medium term.', 'And though the fog of war makes economic forecasting difficult, some of what the future holds for Ukraine is already visible today.', 'According to Deloitte, the Ukrainian economy will not survive without structural changes. Agricultural exports, for example, will depend on developing rail routes as an alternative to maritime ports. And the metallurgy industry should not rely on restoring Soviet legacy infrastructure, but rather invest in innovative production such as green steel.', 'Researcher Oleksandr Zabirko believes Ukraine’s Donbas could end up like other post-industrial regions of Europe, such as the Ruhr in Germany and Upper Silesia in Poland. “Obviously, the role of the E.U. in Ukraine’s recovery will be key, and I doubt that European investors will want to rebuild monstrous Soviet factories like Sievierodonetsk’s Azot and Mariupol’s Azovstal,” Zabirko speculates. In other words, E.U. investment will likely be aimed at developing new industries — running contrary to the interests of Ukrainian “steel barons” like Akhmetov.', 'As such, post-war reconstruction could radically reshape Ukraine. Small- and medium-sized businesses, including ones in new industries like IT, began to flourish after the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, but massive Soviet-built factories continued to play a key role in the country’s economy until Russia’s 2022 invasion. Now, it seems the country’s economic revival will largely depend on its ability to produce and sell high-tech goods.', 'A geographical shift in Ukraine’s economy is also underway, with enterprises moving from the industrial southeast to the country’s west and center. This shift, first and foremost, is for security reasons: even in the event of a frozen conflict, Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions will remain under constant threat. It’s also logistically more convenient since Ukraine has severed ties with its eastern neighbors and is strengthening its economic cooperation with the E.U.', 'This westward migration began in March 2022, when the government launched a free relocation program for Ukrainian businesses. The program helped companies move their employees and equipment to safer regions. Enterprises that have taken advantage of the program range from a small Kyiv-based adhesive tape producer to the Zaporizhzhia Non-ferrous Metals Plant and the distillery behind Khortytsa vodka.', 'Ukraine’s western and central regions are also taking in displaced people from the occupied territories. The Rating Group’s research shows trends towards population growth in the Zakarpattia, Khmelnytskyi, Vinnytsia, Kirovohrad, Odesa, and Dnipropetrovsk regions, as well as in Kyiv.', 'According to sociologist Ella Libanova, who heads the Institute for Demography and Social Studies at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, the country’s central regions have the greatest potential for denser settlement. (Citing ecologists, Libanova said that much of western Ukraine has nearly reached its ecological carrying capacity, which means it will soon be impossible to build new housing, businesses, and industry there.)', 'Libanova also estimates that Ukraine will need to attract around 300,000 immigrants annually to keep its population at the predicted 30 million. Given the low standard of living, these immigrants will most likely come from poorer countries.', 'When it comes to restoring any country, the most crucial factor isn’t money or the size of the population; the attitude of those living there and those who will return is far more important. Without their faith in the future, no amount of investment will work.', 'And in this sense, things look optimistic for Ukraine. According to the Rating Group’s polls, despite all the hardships of wartime life and the setbacks at the front, 80 percent of Ukrainians believe their country’s future looks “rather promising.”', 'Hello, I’m Eilish Hart, the editor of The Beet.

        "article": "Russia arrested two more top Defense Ministry officials on May 23 in what appears to be a widening anti-corruption sweep. Four generals are now in pre-trial detention on felony charges, with three accused of taking multimillion-ruble bribes and the fourth suspected of large-scale fraud. The arrests have coincided with the ouster of longtime Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who lost his post earlier this month to Andrey Belousov, a former deputy prime minister who specializes in economics. Speaking to journalists on May 23, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov rebuffed questions about a “purge” of the Defense Ministry. Here’s what we know about the arrests so far.', 'On April 23, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov was arrested on felony charges of accepting an “especially large bribe,” which investigators estimated at around 1.125 billion rubles ($12.4 million).', 'Ivanov isn’t a military man. He got his start in the fuel and energy sector and then, in 2012, spent several months serving as the chairman of the Moscow regional government under then-Governor Sergey Shoigu.', 'Ivanov was appointed deputy defense minister in 2016 and oversaw numerous major construction projects, including the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces, Patriot Park theme park, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, and the “restoration” of occupied and war-torn Mariupol.', 'Following Ivanov’s arrest, his lawyer speculated that “films” about his client prompted the criminal case. In 2022, Alexey Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation released an investigation into Ivanov and his wife Svetlana, which revealed their lavish vacations in Europe (where they rented expensive villas and yachts) and their ownership of a mansion in central Moscow. In June 2022, Ivanov divorced Svetlana, and, as Navalny’s associates discovered, began dating Maria Kitayeva — a former advisor to Shoigu who was previously married to another Defense Ministry official.', 'Shoigu suspended Ivanov from his duties following his arrest. Citing two sources close to Russia’s Federal Security Service (the FSB), the independent news site iStories reported that Ivanov was charged with bribery to cover up a treason investigation. However, this version of events hasn’t been confirmed by other sources.', 'Two other individuals were arrested in connection with Ivanov’s case: Sergey Borodin, a friend whose company allegedly built Ivanov’s country house in Russia’s Tver region, and Alexander Fomin, the co-owner of the leading construction company working in occupied Mariupol.', 'On May 8, Ivanov appealed his pre-trial detention in court. His lawyers brought “four bags” of awards that Ivanov had received to the hearing, but the official still lost his appeal to be placed under house arrest. Ivanov has denied the bribery charges against him.', 'Three weeks after Ivanov’s arrest, on May 13, another Defense Ministry official was arrested on the same charges of large-scale bribery: the head of the ministry’s Main Personnel Directorate, Lieutenant GeneralYuri Kuznetsov.', 'Investigators alleged that during his tenure from 2021–2023 as head of the 8th Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Kuznetsov “accepted a bribe from representatives of commercial structures for performing certain actions on their behalf.” During a raid of Kuznetsov’s home in the Moscow region, law enforcement reportedly confiscated more $1 million worth of rubles, foreign currency, gold coins, collectible watches, and luxury goods.', 'According to the Russian business daily Kommersant, Kuznetsov stands accused of taking a bribe worth 30.5 million rubles ($338,000) for assisting in securing government contracts worth 372 million rubles ($4.1 million). Investigators allege that in exchange for the contracts, businessman Leva Martirosyan bought land in Krasnodar and built a house on it, registering the property in Kuznetsov’s wife’s name.', 'Kuznetsov has denied the charges against him. At an appeal hearing on May 23, he stated that “as an honest citizen,” he kept all his savings “either in bank accounts, as expected, or at home.” Kuznetsov also asked the court to take the state of his health into consideration when deciding his pre-trial measures, claiming that overworking had caused him a number of ailments. The court rejected Kuznetsov’s appeal, leaving him in pre-trial detention.', 'A day before Kuznetsov’s arrest, Vladimir Putin removed Sergey Shoigu from his post as Russia’s defense minister, which he had held for nearly 12 years. Russian pro-war and Z-blogger Telegram channels linked Ivanov and Kuznetsov’s arrests to “purges” within the ministry. Mikhail Zvinchuk, the creator of the Telegram channel Rybar and a former member of the Russian Defense Ministry’s press service, wrote that the news of Ivanov and Kuznetsov’s arrests was met with “great enthusiasm” on the front lines.', 'On May 21, news broke that police had arrested another military official, career officer Major General Ivan Popov, the former commander of Russia’s 58th Army. But whereas Ivanov and Kuznetsov were charged with bribery, Popov was accused of large-scale fraud.', 'Popov was relieved of his command back in July 2023 and has claimed that he was dismissed after informing his superiors about problems related to the Russian military’s “combat operations” and “logistics.” Former Ukrainian lawmaker and Donbas separatist leader Oleg Tsaryov later reported that Popov was sent to Syria “in a leadership role.” (Anonymous Telegram channels said the same.)', 'Citing a source in the Defense Ministry, Vedemosti reported that the criminal case against Popov was initiated in connection with the theft and sale of metal products intended for the construction of fortifications at the front. Russia’s Investigative Committee said that Popov was involved in the theft of some 1,700 tons of “rolled metal products” worth more than 130 million rubles ($1.4 million), which were purchased by the Kremlin-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, where Popov led occupying troops before his dismissal.', 'On May 23, the Investigative Committee requested Popov’s transfer from pre-trial detention to house arrest.', 'Popov has pleaded not guilty and his father claims he was most likely set up. “He said something to his superiors, some truth, and that’s when it all started,” Popov’s father told the Telegram channel Baza.', 'Even though we’re outlawed in Russia, we continue to deliver exclusive reporting and analysis from inside the country.', 'Our journalists on the ground take risks to keep you informed about changes in Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.SupportMeduza’s work today.', 'Also on May 23, news broke of the arrest of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin, the deputy chief of the Russian army’s General Staff and the head of its Main Communications Directorate. Investigators claim that between April 2016 and October 2023, Shamarin accepted 36 million rubles (around $400,000) in bribes from Telta, a telephone company based in Perm, in exchange for “increasing the volume of products supplied” under Defense Ministry contracts.', 'Shamarin was placed in pre-trial custody for two months. According to the state news agency TASS, he has pleaded not guilty.', 'Citing sources in law enforcement, TASS also reported that two Telta employees, CEO Alexey Vysokov and chief accountant Elena Grishina testified against Shamarin. Vysokov and Grishina were arrested on charges of large-scale fraud in June 2023, along with former Telta director Igor Morozov.', 'Asked to comment on whether Shamarin’s arrest was part of a “purge” of the Defense Ministry, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “The fight against corruption is a consistent effort.

        "article": "Seeking to evade sanctions and circumvent the G7’s oil price cap, Russia has begun using a shadow fleet of decrepit second-hand tankers to covertly move oil around the world. These ships, registered to overseas shell companies, ferry oil to buyers willing to flout the G7 cap. While this scheme has allowed the Kremlin to continue selling oil at higher prices, the choice might be more political than financial. The independent news outletiStories dug into Russia’s reasons for creating its own shadow fleet and found out how the network works and what the West is doing to stop it. Meduza shares an abridged English-language version of the outlet’s findings.', 'In December 2022, the G7 countries, the E.U., and Australia set a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil exported by sea. The aim was to reduce Russia’s export revenues without causing a sharp drop in the supply of Russian oil to the global market. After the start of the full-scale war, Western governments began to turn away from Russian oil, with the E.U. eventually banning seaborne oil products from the country. Western companies, however, continued to transport and insure shipments. Now, with the price cap in place, these companies face sanctions if that oil was purchased at $60 or more.', 'As soon as discussions about the price cap began, Russia declared it wouldn’t sell oil to anyone who adhered to it. Then, it started looking for ways to circumvent the restrictions. Russia’s main move was setting up a shadow fleet of oil tankers to ship oil to buyers willing to disregard the price cap. This isn’t a new idea: Iran and Venezuela have long used shadow fleets to circumvent international sanctions.', 'While the West was discussing the terms of the price cap, Russia began buying up used tankers worldwide. According to the commodities trader Trafigura, by February 2023, about 600 tankers were transporting Russian oil and oil products under the radar. By December, that number had grown to 1,089, according to the analytics firm Vortexa. At that time, 75 percent of the world’s shadow fleet was exporting Russian oil, with 66 percent solely dedicated to deliveries from Russia. Analysts from the maritime AI company Windward estimate that shadow vessels account for 18 percent of all shipments worldwide.', 'The bitter truth is that events in Russia affect your life, too. Help Meduza continue to bring news from Russia to readers around the world by setting up amonthly donation.', 'Russia spent about $8.5 billion on purchasing its own shadow tankers, with most of this money coming from state funds, writes Craig Kennedy, an expert on the Russian oil industry who runs the Navigating Russia newsletter on Substack. Hundreds of companies were created worldwide to manage the tankers. Bloomberg estimates that by December of last year, shadow vessels were transporting about 45 percent of Russia’s oil.', 'Winward analysts divide the shadow fleet into “dark” and “gray” vessels. Ships in the dark fleet often disable their identification system while transporting illegal cargo, and hide or falsify their location. They frequently change names, flags, and nominal owners and have insurance from non-Western companies or sail without insurance at all. By the end of last year, the dark fleet numbered about 1,100 vessels worldwide. The gray fleet is a new phenomenon, emerging shortly after Russia’s full-scale war with Ukraine began. The approximately 900 ships in this fleet are registered to shell companies created to conceal the true owners and to appear law-abiding. Many tankers in the gray fleet also “flag hop.”', 'More than 80 percent of tankers in the dark fleet and 60 percent in the gray fleet are over 16 years old, according to Winward. The age and condition of the shadow fleet worry environmentalists. By May of this year, there had been at least 50 incidents involving such ships, including fires, technical malfunctions, collisions, and oil spills at sea, according to a report by the insurance company Allianz. Often the countries in whose waters the incidents occurred ended up footing the bill for the damage, or, in the case of collisions, the other vessels involved bore the expenses. Shadow fleet tankers are de facto uninsured, writes the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA).', 'Tankers load Russian oil at three locations: Russian ports in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and the Far East. According to Winward, by the end of last year, the primary buyers were China, India, and (in much smaller quantities) Turkey. During transportation, the oil is sometimes transferred from ship to ship to conceal its origin and make it difficult to track the companies involved — a maneuver that increases the risk of oil spills.', 'Some of the Russian oil purchased this way may be sold on the buyers’ domestic markets, but it’s mainly either resold or refined and then sold as petroleum products to other countries, including those in Europe. For instance, in 2023, the volume of Russian oil imports to India increased by 140 percent, while the export of petroleum products from India to E.U. countries rose by 115 percent. Companies that track oil supplies say it’s impossible to determine the origin of the oil used to make gasoline, diesel, or kerosene.', 'It’s likely that Turkey is operating in a similar fashion. From February 2023 to February 2024, the country increased its purchases of Russian oil by 105 percent compared to the previous year. During the same period, Turkish fuel exports to the E.U. grew by 107 percent.', 'Exporting via the shadow fleet allows Russia to sell oil above the $60 price cap. According to the Russian Finance Ministry, in 2023, the average price for Urals oil, the blend used as the price benchmark for Russian oil exports, was $62.99 per barrel. This year, it’s risen significantly — from $64.14 in January to $74.98 in April.', 'The problem for Russia is that it’s more expensive to transport oil this way. Carriers have raised prices due to sanction-related risks, and the route to India from Russia’s Baltic and Black Sea ports is significantly longer than to Europe, making it more expensive. (Russia exports oil to China from its Far East ports, which is a much more economically viable route.) Moreover, buyers drive down the price as the cap gives them leverage to demand higher discounts on Russian oil.', 'Craig Kennedy believes that economically speaking, it would make more sense for Russia to transport its oil on standard tankers, even if it had to sell at a price below $60 per barrel. Doing so would eliminate the expenses associated with purchasing and maintaining shadow fleet vessels. However, from a political perspective, selling oil under conditions dictated by the West is most likely out of the question.', 'Naturally, there’s no official registry of shadow fleet vessels, and formally, if a tanker doesn’t belong to or use the services of companies from countries that have imposed a price cap, it’s not violating any rules.', 'In reality, however, Russian oil is being transported by companies whose ships are serviced in the West and who own assets there. In October, the U.S. started imposing sanctions against them, targeting both the companies and the tankers themselves so that the vessels can’t just be reregistered to evade restrictions. By February, about 50 tankers were under U.S. sanctions, half of which stopped working with Russian oil, Bloomberg reported.', 'It’s likely that the U.S. will continue to identify individual companies and ships that are violating the price cap and impose sanctions on them. However, more extreme measures, such as seizing tankers in the territorial waters of Western countries, are unlikely as this could lead to serious escalation. Banning the sale of used tankers to Russia would also be ineffective, as Russia could easily circumvent this using shell companies.', 'The growth rate of the Russian shadow fleet slowed even before the U.S. started imposing sanctions, notes Kennedy. Purchases peaked in the first quarter of 2023, when Russia bought about 60 tankers. Since then, Russia has been buying fewer and fewer ships. In the last quarter of 2023, after sanctions were imposed, Russia bought only 20. Currently, the fate of the shadow fleet largely depends on whether the U.S. will continue to impose sanctions, and if so, to what extent. Kennedy believes that the U.S. can significantly reduce the number of shadow vessels this way without risking the global market. The Russian shadow fleet will also be one of the targets of the new 14th package of E.U. sanctions, Reuters reported in April. According to Bloomberg, these sanctions will impose restriction on 11 Russian vessels.",

        "article": "A new long-form report by BBC Russia journalists Elizaveta Fokht and Nina Nazarova describes the threat of domestic violence from returning Russian soldiers. Their story focuses on the experiences of a 30-year-old mother in the Tyumen region whose common-law husband, Ilya Reshilov, started abusing her, their children, and her mother after serving in Ukraine with Wagner Group to escape a nine-year prison sentence for killing a man in a fight. After coming home from the war, Ilya began drinking heavily and beating his family. One night, while drunk, he even threatened to decapitate his wife, saying she had the “face of a Ukrainian,” and vowed that his Wagner Group comrades would save him from any punishment. After midnight, a few nights of death threats and assaults later, Ilya’s wife finally reported him to the police, but officers didn’t rush to the scene but waited until noon the next day. He was eventually sentenced to six years in prison, and his wife moved away with their children, but Ilya is now reportedly back in Ukraine, a soldier freed from prison once again.', 'The BBC Russia investigation also describes the general trends of domestic abuse by soldiers (many of whom are violent convicts released early) returning home with PTSD. The Russian government has been reluctant to study the issue, let alone devote resources to psychological care for veterans or preventative healthcare. The reigning expert consensus among the authorities, embodied by work from psychologist Mikhail Reshetnikov, claims that Western research exhibits a “hysteria over the possible number of post-traumatic disorders.” Reshetnikov and his adherents in the government argue that American experiences with traumatized soldiers and domestic violence don’t apply to Russian veterans because the latter are merely defending their families and way of life, not fighting “unjust wars on foreign soil.”', 'In this environment, violent veterans often avoid serious punishments (which they can evade at any rate by returning to the war), and women fear turning to the police, worried that their abusers will get off lightly and return home soon, only angrier and more dangerous.', 'A new investigation from The Insider describes the rise of desertion in the Russian army. According to research by journalists at Mediazona, the authorities have filed more than 8,000 AWOL and desertion cases since February 2022, and courts now issue up to 700 sentences each month for these offenses. The Insider explains that career officers, volunteers, and contract soldiers are increasingly appealing to the “Get Lost” project for help with desertion. The most common reasons for wanting to leave the Russian military are exhaustion from the war, supply issues, and suicidal orders from commanders. Soldiers typically sneak away while on leave, when hospitalized, and during redeployments.', 'Desertion early in the war was closely associated with ethnic minorities, and the biggest single instances of mass desertion occurred in Wagner Group and “Storm-Z” units that consisted mainly of recruited convicts. More recently, says The Insider, deserters report that attitudes among their relatives back home in Russia have shifted, and it’s become easier to reconcile them to their decision to flee the military and the war.', 'On May 21, the Russian Defense Ministry published a draft decree that, if approved, would unilaterally change its maritime borders with Lithuania and Finland. Then, on Tuesday, multiple Russian state media outlets reported that, according to a “military-diplomatic source,” the authorities were never planning to alter the boundary. By Wednesday afternoon, the document had disappeared from the Russian government’s website. Meduza explains how the episode unfolded and how Russia’s neighbors on the Baltic responded.', 'Seeking to evade sanctions and circumvent the G7’s oil price cap, Russia has begun using a shadow fleet of decrepit second-hand tankers to covertly move oil around the world. These ships, registered to overseas shell companies, ferry oil to buyers willing to flout the G7 cap. While this scheme has allowed the Kremlin to continue selling oil at higher prices, the choice might be more political than financial. The independent news outlet iStories dug into Russia’s reasons for creating its own shadow fleet and found out how the network works and what the West is doing to stop it.', 'Investigative journalists at Agentstvo identified two of the actresses who appear in a new music video spread online earlier this week by the “Dvoinik” Russian disinformation botnet. Both Alisa Valikova and Daria Carlo confirmed their participation in the filming but did not reveal who produced the video. The music clip begins with a joke that Biden’s 2020 election victory was a hoax and then features actors depicting Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a rapid, sometimes incoherent, montage of scenes lampooning the incumbent president’s immigration and Ukraine policies. An apparent mix of traditional makeup and AI software, someone depicting musician Ilya Prusikin also sings in the footage, which is itself designed to look like a music video from Prusikin’s popular band Little Big.', 'Researchers at Verstka Media and the DumaBingo monitoring project publish monthly reports on lobbying trends in Russia’s State Duma. In April 2024, deputies submitted 60 bills for consideration and adopted the third and final reading of eight draft laws, sending them to the Federation Council for approval before they go to the president. Here are the month’s most egregious examples of lobbyist legislation:', 'Journalists at Agentstvo Media report that Russian judges sentenced five times as many convicts in “political cases” to compulsory psychiatric treatment last year as they did in the two prior years. Judges sent at least 25 “political case” defendants to psychiatric hospitals in 2023 and at least eight defendants in the first 4.5 months of 2024. The outlet says this is a conservative estimate, given that some defendants likely aren’t reporting their sentences due to stigmas about psychiatric care. Others might fear drawing unwanted attention to their case, possibly risking prison terms. (Agentstvo defines political cases as convictions for “repressive criminal statutes,” including “inciting extremism,” “justifying terrorism,” “discrediting the army,” “disseminating disinformation,” “calling for sanctions against Russian nationals and entities,” and so on.)', 'Agentstvo notes that the Russian judicial system’s growing reliance on compulsory psychiatric treatment still falls well short of how widespread the practice was in ruling against Soviet dissidents. Additionally, the vast majority of contemporary sentences involve general psychiatric hospitals, not the special “intensive observation” facilities under police control operated in the USSR.', 'Vladimir Putin has signed a new executive order requiring Russians with access to high-level state secrets to notify the Federal Security and Foreign Intelligence services at least 30 days before traveling abroad. Notifications must include travel dates, border-crossing points, detailed itineraries, duration, and addresses abroad. The new rules exempt officials who are carrying out direct presidential orders and other senior officials guarded by the Federal Protective Service (perhaps to conceal this agency’s actions from the FSB and SVR). The new rules also make some exceptions for late notifications in case of medical emergencies or unscheduled travel.', 'The executive order also applies to lawyers, raising fears that it will be used to pressure attorneys defending suspects in treason cases. For example, the new travel restrictions could become grounds for increased surveillance of lawyers, violations of the new rules could be used to deny attorneys access to key case evidence, and federal officials might even ban attorneys from going abroad at all.",

        "article": "May 20 marked five years since Volodymyr Zelensky was inaugurated as Ukraine’s president. Ukrainian law mandates that presidential terms cannot exceed five years. However, the law also requires the president to remain in office until a new head of state is in place — and with martial law currently in effect, Ukraine’s elections have been postponed. Predictably, Russian propagandists and politicians have pounced on this contradiction, claiming that Zelensky’s presidency is now “illegitimate.” Meduza spoke with representatives from Zelensky’s office, Ukrainian opposition politicians, and ordinary citizens to learn how people in Ukraine feel about postponing the vote and what it means for the Zelensky government’s legitimacy.', 'For several months, Russian officials and propagandists have been spreading the narrative that after May 20, Volodymyr Zelensky would supposedly lose formal legitimacy as Ukraine’s president.', 'On April 28, for example, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated: “Zelensky’s fate is unambiguously predetermined, and very soon, the moment will come when many, including [people] in Ukraine, will question his legitimacy.”', 'Viktor Medvedchuk, who led the pro-Kremlin party Opposition Platform – For Life (and whose youngest daughter is Vladimir Putin’s goddaughter), echoed this sentiment on May 2. Medvedchuk was charged with treason back in 2021 but escaped house arrest in the early days of the full-scale war. He was recaptured in April 2022 and exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners of war the following September.', 'Putin himself commented on the situation cautiously, saying that “this question should first and foremost be answered by Ukraine’s political and legal system.” Meanwhile, Russian propagandists are telling their followers that on May 21, “Zelensky’s legitimacy will come to a complete end” and that this, among other things, may affect Ukrainians’ willingness to fight for their country.', 'Even though we’re outlawed in Russia, we continue to deliver exclusive reporting and analysis from inside the country.', 'Our journalists on the ground take risks to keep you informed about changes in Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.SupportMeduza’s work today.', 'Due to a legal contradiction, President Zelensky’s term has indeed formally ended. According to the Ukrainian Constitution, presidential terms are strictly limited to five years — and Zelensky was inaugurated on May 20, 2019. At the same time, Article 108 of the Ukrainian Constitution states that the president must fulfill his duties until a new head of state is elected. Before the full-scale war began, the next elections were scheduled for March 31, 2024. But now, they’ve been postponed due to martial law, which will be in effect in Ukraine until at least August 11.', 'In the summer of 2023, Zelensky suggested that it might still be possible to hold elections and said that if so, he would run for reelection. However, he noted that it would be very difficult to ensure security at polling stations under wartime conditions. That fall, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Zelensky was constantly weighing the pros and cons of holding elections based on the situation at the front and other war-related factors.', 'Ultimately, on November 6, 2023, the president stated that “now is not the time for elections.” “We must recognize that now is the time for defense, the time for a battle that will decide the fate of the state and its people, not the time for the kind of disinformation that only Russia would expect from Ukraine,” he said.', 'This statement came against the backdrop of Zelensky’s reported conflict with General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, then the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. During the war, Zaluzhnyi became the second most popular person in Ukraine, and some Ukrainian experts suggested that Zaluzhnyi could pose serious competition to Zelensky if he decided to run for office. On February 8, amidst these discussions, Zaluzhnyi was dismissed from his post as Ukraine’s top commander. On May 9, Zelensky appointed him as ambassador to the United Kingdom.', '“The country is at war, and holding elections is impossible. The overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian population understands this perfectly well. The legitimacy of the Ukrainian president is not in question at all,” Yevhen Holovakha, the director of the Institute of Sociology at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, told Meduza. He emphasized that Ukrainians are currently dealing with “much more pressing issues than Russian disinformation campaigns about our government’s legitimacy.”', 'Volodymyr Paniotto, the head of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), agreed. He noted that in the fall of 2023, following Oleksiy Arestovych’s announcement that he intended to run for president, there was discussion in Ukrainian society about whether or not elections should be held. Arestovych suggested conducting elections via the government app Diia, claiming 90 percent of Ukrainians are registered there. But Paniotto told Meduza that this number is entirely inaccurate: sociologists estimate that only 56 percent of Ukrainians use the Diia app. “In my view, [holding elections] is sheer fantasy,” Paniotto said. “Neither those on the front lines nor those who have left [the country] would be able to vote.”', 'In October 2023, KIIS conducted its first survey asking Ukrainians when they thought the next elections should be held; 81 percent of respondents answered that it should take place only after the war. The institute then polled people with more detailed questions and varied wording, but each time “the population clearly expressed opposition” to holding elections during the war, Paniotto explained.', 'The Razumkov Center think tank also polled Ukrainians about elections. A survey conducted from March 21–27 showed that 59.5 percent of respondents felt negatively about holding elections before the end of the war; only 22 percent viewed the idea of holding elections positively. “[In recent weeks], we haven’t even been conducting surveys on this topic; we don’t see it as an issue,” Paniotto added.', 'Ukraine’s Western partners share this view. For instance, during his visit to Kyiv in early May, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that elections in Ukraine would take place when “Ukrainians agree that conditions allow [for it].”', 'There aren’t any influential factions in Ukraine’s parliament that are seriously interested in disputing the president’s legitimacy, according to a Verkhovna Rada source who spoke with Meduza. He noted that deputies have only publicly raised this issue a few times — such as when former speaker Dmytro Razumkov suggested that the Constitutional Court should consider the matter.', 'The source believes that any talk of Zelensky’s “illegitimacy” is an attempt by Russian authorities to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. “It’s hard to say whether Russia can do anything at the level of [Ukrainian domestic] politics. People aren’t protesting over this issue. [The Russians] will stir things up among regular citizens on TikTok and Telegram channels,” he continued.', 'When asked whether officials had prepared for May 21 in any specific way, a source close to Zelensky’s office gave a vague answer: “The preparation is always the same: doing our job. This includes combating propaganda and opposition that isn’t always rational.” He added that, to his knowledge, the authorities conducted “some [closed] surveys” among the public about Zelensky’s legitimacy after May 20, but he refused to disclose the results.', '“People don’t always understand why we’re asking about May 21. Nobody reads the Constitution over lunch,” he said. He added that there are no plans to hold presidential elections anytime soon: “We’re in very tough times. In this kind of situation, people aren’t thinking so much about politics. Ask a Kharkiv resident about elections now, and you’ll hear something unprintable.”', 'A deputy from a major opposition party in the Verkhovna Rada agreed with this assessment. He said that nobody in parliament raises the issue of elections because “any comment from any politician on this matter will be seen as a provocation,” and “no parliamentary force talks about this because nobody wants to look crazy.”', 'I’d be the first to want presidential elections since I’m in opposition to Zelensky, but right now it’s impossible. How will soldiers be able to vote? How will [Ukrainian] refugees vote? Who will guarantee safety during the vote count when rockets and bombs are flying? It’s impossible. And Ukrainian law states that the president and parliament exercise their powers until the next elections.', 'Sociologist Volodymyr Paniotto also said that the Ukrainian opposition doesn’t try to exploit the idea of “Zelensky’s illegitimacy” in any way.He believes this is partially due to the fact that, according to all polls, the only person who could compete with the incumbent president is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, not any of the opposition figures (including former president Petro Poroshenko). “All the others are far behind Zelensky,” Paniotto added. He thinks that if elections were held in Ukraine right now and Zaluzhnyi decided to run, he could defeat Zelensky, “but it’s unclear whether [Zaluzhnyi] will ever run.”', 'Reporting byElizaveta Antonova",

        "article": "In late April, the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a network of hundreds of economics researchers from around the world, published a new report on the future reconstruction of Ukraine’s economy. While the organization released its first “Ukraine Reconstruction Plan” in March 2022, its new recommendations are significantly more detailed and reckon with the harsh realities of the grinding, years-long slog the war has become. Meduza special correspondent Margarita Lyutova spoke to one of the report’s key authors, Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance professor at Goethe University Frankfurt and a member of the German Federal Finance Ministry’s Academic Advisory Board. Meduza shares an English-language summary of their conversation.', 'Even the most optimistic forecasts for the future of the war in Ukraine acknowledge that the weeks and months ahead will be difficult; while the U.S.’s latest military aid package has begun to arrive, the long delay in its passage allowed Russia to make key gains on the battlefield. While President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Ukraine had largely managed to stave off Russia’s latest offensive in the Kharkiv region so far, he warned it may be just the first of several waves.', 'With the war’s future as uncertain as ever and any semblance of a peace agreement still a distant prospect, discussions of how to approach the reconstruction of Ukraine’s economy may seem premature. According to economist Jan Pieter Krahnen, however, if the country wants to avoid past mistakes and make the most of postwar investments, it’s now “high time” for policymakers to begin strategizing.', 'As Krahnen and his co-authors argue in CEPR’s new report, Ukraine’s Reconstruction: Policy Options for Building an Effective Financial Architecture, Ukraine can’t simply count on foreign grants and one-time investments to rebuild its economy after the war. For one thing, it’s no longer clear that enough money is forthcoming to even begin this process.', '“In the early days of the war, it was not a big topic. ‘Of course this money will come,’ [we thought]. ‘We have the E.U., we have the U.S., we have Germany, France, etc.’ There were enough donors, in a way that seemed to add up to big sums,” Krahnen tells Meduza. He continues:', 'But as time goes on, the support has dwindled a bit. And despite my expectation that there will be significant amounts of money available, these amounts will by no means be enough to cover the investment outlays that will be necessary not only to rebuild physical infrastructure in the country that has been destroyed but also to bring the economy up to speed.', 'For this reason, according to Krahnen, the grants and loans that will be available to Ukraine after the war will not be enough to make the country “competitive with other European economies” or to “orient the whole Ukrainian economy in a stronger sense than before towards its Western neighbors.” Instead, accomplishing these goals will require what Krahnen and his colleagues refer to as “building back better,” a process that he says will entail restructuring the corporate sector as well as the agricultural, energy, and raw materials sectors, among others. And for this, he explains, the available grant funding will not suffice.', '“So there is a demand to access the market for private investment,” he tells Meduza. “And this is a global market. In a certain sense —price-wise, information-wise —it’s an integrated global market where Ukraine is competing with the U.S. and other countries for funding.”', 'To attract the “big pension funds, big institutional investors, big banking groups, and asset managers that might put their money where they think the return is,” Krahnen says, Ukraine needs to make its market attractive enough. Broadly speaking, he explains, this will require “onboarding international money and channeling it to good firms.”', 'But this is easier said than done. “To make a system a trusted system is one of the hardest exercises I can think of,” Krahnen says. “Much of my academic life was actually concerned with [the question of how to] establish what we call incentive alignment —in other words, [ensuring that] people to whom we hand over money will do what they have claimed to do and what we expect them to do. How can we ensure this?”', 'This question, according to Krahnen, is key to whether Ukraine’s postwar economy will succeed. While this may sound abstract, he says, it’s “essentially what institution-building everywhere in the world is all about.” And while economists and policymakers do have an arsenal of tools for ensuring trust and confidence in a market, creating the institutions this requires takes time.', '“You need to create a legal framework that is suitable for such an endeavor,” he says, continuing:', 'You need to have institutional variety, diversity, an institutional setup that is competitive among [institutions] but still accountable to investors, owners, [and] lenders. [This] needs to be done now in order to be ready for delivery one or two years from now. And all of our suggestions should be read as an attempt to formulate conditions for such a sustainable financial system.', 'Krahnen says that while the CEPR’s new report has been met with reservations from the National Bank of Ukraine and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), its recommendations seem to have resonated with Germany’s Federal Finance Ministry. According to him, that’s no coincidence: the report includes an entire chapter dedicated to Germany’s experience with the Marshall Plan and the lessons it holds for Ukraine.', '“The major insight of our chapter on the Marshall Plan is that it’s not the amount of money that made the Marshall Plan successful, because that wasn’t that much after all,” he says. “But the money […] was used in Germany to build institutions rather than directly funding some infrastructure project, [in which] you do it once and it’s gone.”', 'Even though we’re outlawed in Russia, we continue to deliver exclusive reporting and analysis from inside the country.', 'Our journalists on the ground take risks to keep you informed about changes in Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.SupportMeduza’s work today.', 'Krahnen and his colleagues propose the creation of a bank in Ukraine analogous to Germany’s KfW,which was established as part of the Marshall Plan and is now the country’s second-largest bank. “[KfW] does a lot of policy work,” he explains. “For instance, we have this energy transition—something that needs a lot of support money to be viable on the household level and on the firm level.” While KfW helps finance projects like these, it’s not responsible for finding good projects or conducting due diligence; instead, “they just do refinancing of the banks for extending the loans that they give to the client.”', 'While Ukraine already has a number of state-owned banks, Krahnen says that what the CEPR is proposing is a “state-owned bank [that would] get rid of all the others: “The bank we are suggesting would not be a commercial bank that competes with other commercial banks. […] What we suggest is a state-owned bank that channels international money into the banking sector as such and follows certain conditionalities, certain principles [governing] where this money should be spent,” he explains.', 'While the proposal might sound on its face like a push for more centralized control of Ukraine’s economy, Krahnen says that the opposite is true: privatizing the country’s existing banks and replacing them with a Tier 2 bank —an institution whose only clients are other banks —would help Ukraine develop a more market-based economy.', 'According to Krahnen, this system would avoid turning the new bank into a bottleneck of red tape by leaving client selection and monitoring responsibilities with the Tier 1, customer-facing banks, while minimizing corruption and perverse incentives through mechanisms such as co-lending.', '“[This] means we only put Tier 2 bank money where the Tier 1 bank also puts their own money,” he says. “That’s a mechanism to ensure that the bad projects will not be targeted with this money.”', 'Ukraine’s banking system was in poor shape even before the war. According to Krahnen, the country’s banking sector is plagued by non-performing loans (NPLs) while also containing an “unmatched” volume of government bonds. The result is an aggregate balance sheet with approximately half of its assets “sitting there doing nothing in the economy,” he says.', '“The proposal that we’re making in this report is to unfreeze, so to speak, bank balance sheets, and make them useful for the recovery,” Krahnen explains.', 'To accomplish this, the report’s authors propose obligating state-owned banks to sell their debt to a newly-created “bad bank” — an institution specially designed to isolate and liquidate Ukraine’s NPLs — within 10 years. The banks would also be required to find private owners.', '“Since privatization is so delicate in many Eastern European countries, [...] we do not claim to have a silver bullet that solves it,” Krahnen notes. “But we would say [to the banks]: ‘Take care, give yourself time, use all the expertise you can get to build stable ownership groups.’ We don’t want to produce the next oligarchs.”', 'When it comes to specific infrastructure restoration projects, such as the reconstruction of a power plant, Krahnen says, the EBRD is largely capable of handling the process. The new development bank that he and his colleagues are proposing would in some ways act as a competitor to the European bank —and, according to him, it opposes the idea for this reason. But Krahnen sees the competition as a positive outcome.', '“My own take is that such a national development bank would empower Ukraine to participate more strongly in what they favor and what they don’t favor,” he explains. “[...] If you externalize too much of your financial architecture, you will lose control, in a democratic sense, of what’s going on in your country.”', 'It’s also important to build up Ukraine’s domestic banking infrastructure to protect it from the risk of outside banks abruptly leaving the country, according to Krahnen. “In the end, foreign institutions are governed by their own bottom line,” he says. “And if this bottom line is in trouble for reasons completely unrelated to Ukraine, these banks would go home.”', 'At the same time, the economist adds, there are good reasons to include foreign institutions in the oversight process:', 'In a country where international investors fear corruption and interference from different sides, you would like to tell them: “Don’t fear too much interference here, because we’ve constructed an institutional setup that doesn’t make that so easy.” And this is the best we can do: we can hand over control to an outsider, or at least part of that control. And if we trust the outsider, we can more or less trust the result in that country.', 'Underreportedstories. Freshperspectives.

        "article": "In late April, the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a network of hundreds of economics researchers from around the world, published a new report on the future reconstruction of Ukraine’s economy. While the organization released its first “Ukraine Reconstruction Plan” in March 2022, its new recommendations are significantly more detailed and reckon with the harsh realities of the grinding, years-long slog the war has become. Meduza special correspondent Margarita Lyutova spoke to one of the report’s key authors, Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance professor at Goethe University Frankfurt and a member of the German Federal Finance Ministry’s Academic Advisory Board.', 'May 20 marked five years since Volodymyr Zelensky was inaugurated as Ukraine’s president. Ukrainian law mandates that presidential terms cannot exceed five years. However, the law also requires the president to remain in office until a new head of state is in place — and with martial law currently in effect, Ukraine’s elections have been postponed. Predictably, Russian propagandists and politicians have pounced on this contradiction, claiming that Zelensky’s presidency is now “illegitimate.” Meduza spoke with representatives from Zelensky’s office, Ukrainian opposition politicians, and ordinary citizens to learn how people in Ukraine feel about postponing the vote and what it means for the Zelensky government’s legitimacy.', 'Russia introduced jury trials in 1993, and they’ve become virtually the only chance for a not-guilty verdict in Russia’s criminal justice system (juries acquit roughly one-third of defendants while this rate in other courts is less than one percent). However, only a small number of cases in Russia come before juries, and studies show that Russia is gradually phasing out juries entirely as prosecutors contest their verdicts through judges and get the tough sentences they sought initially. For an individual juror’s perspective, journalists at Bumaga Media spoke to “Tatiana,” a woman in St. Petersburg, about her experience serving jury duty in a trial that ran weekly between September 2023 and April 2024. The charges in the case were hardly pedestrian: the illegal purchase and possession of weapons, robbery, drug production, racketeering, and the use of counterfeit documents. Tatiana’s jury acquitted one of the defendants and convicted the other two, which apparently dissatisfied the prosecutors.', 'Tatiana also told Bumaga about the jury selection process, the jurors’ pay scale (which doesn’t cover transportation or meals but does pay full-day honoraria, even on days when the trial lasted just an hour), and the jury’s final deliberations. Tatiana said her personal interest in the judicial system and the rare opportunity to express her civic position through official state channels motivated her to accept jury duty, and the process itself triggered a “complex moral dilemma” as she grappled with the facts of the case and her past brushes with the courts as an activist.', 'A new report by The Insider describes how Russia’s expanded crackdown on the “international LGBT movement” has ravaged formerly gay-friendly clubs nationwide. Repressive new laws and court rulings and police raids have forced the cancelation of drag shows, led to strict new dress codes, and caused spiraling disillusionment among members of Russia’s queer community. Police draw on anonymous complaints and even seize clubs’ own security camera footage to build their “gay propaganda” cases, while “nationalists armed with brass knuckles and bats” intimidate and bully security guards and patrons alike, cultivating an atmosphere of fear and danger.', 'As clubs try to adapt to Russia’s increasingly anti-gay climate, dress codes and other unpopular policies drive away the few remaining patrons who haven’t already fled mobilization or anti-gay political persecution. Relocating to more metropolitan areas in search of greater tolerance has led some to realize that the situation is even worse in places like Moscow. Many drag artists who can’t emigrate have lost their livelihoods and found work at hair and nail salons.', 'Now that Russian law enforcement has the capacity to treat gay culture as felony extremism, the legal risks of operating or even attending a gay club are severe. Some institutions survive through rigorous compliance with anti-gay legislation while maintaining a low public profile, but no level of compliance or silent running guarantees that the authorities won’t come knocking.', 'Earlier this month, human rights activists helped 19-year-old Chechnya native Lia Zaurbekova flee abroad to get away from her abusive family. Zaurbekova managed her escape on May 16 with the help of police officers in Moscow who distracted a large group of Chechen men (including her father) who came to return her to Chechnya against her will. Having failed to grab her in Moscow, Zaurbekova’s father Beslan has since vowed to continue searching for his daughter abroad. Beslan also accuses Lia’s boyfriend (reportedly an ethnic Russian man) of “confusing” her and has threatened to “punish” him if he doesn’t convert to Islam. Separately, Chechen State Duma deputy Adam Delimkhanov says he’s taken personal control over Zaurbekova’s case and echoed her father’s threats and allegations against her partner.', 'According to Holod Media, the Zaurbekova case has united two radically different groups of supporters: women’s rights activists and chauvinist z-bloggers. The latter community has rallied to Zaurbekova in opposition to the anti-Russian, Islamist motivations that guide her abusive family and the Chechen authorities. For example, “Men’s State” founder Vladislav Pozdnyakov has accused Zaurbekova’s relatives of being Nazis and condemned the Moscow police for failing to stand up to Chechen “Wahhabis.” Holod Media reports that others in Pozdnyakov’s camp have also couched their support for Lia Zaurbekova in xenophobic criticisms of Chechens.', 'In an interview for The Insider, literary critic Nikolai Aleksnadrov spoke to Olga Romanova, the director of the civil rights organization Russia Behind Bars, about the past and present of Russia’s prisons. Romanova’s core argument is that private profits drive policy within the Federal Penitentiary Service, shaping attitudes and practices related to prisoner labor, troop recruitment, and trends in persecution and torture. The “merger” between Russia’s state authorities and the criminal world has established a transactional system that determines how prisons are administered. Romanova says this “interpenetration” ensures shared interests in how rights and privileges are extended (and denied) to inmates, particularly when it comes to forced labor and protections against abuse.', 'Thanks to these administrative linkages between officials and criminals, Russia’s shifting geopolitics reverberate in the prison system and trigger purges of the latest “public enemies” from inside the “crime committees” that share power at penitentiaries. Romanova says this happened to Georgian “thieves in law” after Russia’s brief war in 2008. She claims that radical Islamists seized the vacuum left by ousted Georgian criminal bosses. Romanova also argues that an ongoing campaign by prison officials against all Muslim inmates escalated further in the aftermath of the Moscow concert hall terrorist attack in March 2024.', 'According to Romanova, the Federal Penitentiary Service’s reliance on kickbacks and the embezzlement of profits derived from forced labor has — somewhat counterintuitively — made the agency the most anti-war in the federal government. The reason for this attitude is that the war has diluted prisons’ labor pool and diverted funding that might otherwise have maintained or even improved the industrial infrastructure at prison facilities. In other words, the recruitment of prisoners and redirected federal spending have reduced the income of corrupt prison officials (and cut earnings for all the other bureaucrats who collect their own rents in this chain).', '🍿 Struggling Russian movie theaters fall back on pirating Hollywood', 'Russian movie theaters have resumed the illegal screening of Hollywood films. According to a report by Current Time, Russian cinemas briefly caved to demands from domestic film distributors, who interpreted the box-office success of a recent adaptation of the children’s character Cheburashka to mean that Russia’s film industry could boost profits while sustaining theater chains. Cheburashka proved to be an exception, however, and cinemas have now returned to “pre-show screenings” of Hollywood blockbusters ahead of Russian short films. These screenings are illegal, as Hollywood film studies and distributors imposed a boycott on Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.', 'The pro-Kremlin television network Tsargrad now promotes links to streamable pirated copies of Hollywood films on a companion website. To justify the embrace of Western culture (including all the Harry Potter movies and 2024 Oscar-nominated films), the movies are presented as “trophy films” — the Soviet term used to describe foreign (largely German, Austrian, and Italian) documentaries and feature films brought to the USSR as spoils of war in the late 1940s and early 1950s.",

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts.', \"In this courtroom sketch, former President Trump's children — Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump with his wife Lara — sit next to Trump in a front row as defense lawyer Todd Blanche presents closing arguments during Trump's criminal trial on charges he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016 in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on Tuesday. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)\", \"Gowdy, who has been in the New York City courtroom where Trump's case will be decided, said it was unlikely for the jury to find Trump guilty on some charges but not others.\", '\"I cannot foresee a verdict with some counts as guilty and others as not. Unless there is a lesser included misdemeanor charge, in which case there perhaps could be a series of convictions for felony and misdemeanor counts,\" he said.', 'Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island defense attorney, agreed that the jury would render the same verdict on all counts \"because all the felonies are pretty much the same.\"', '\"They\\'re just different instances of the same felony,\" he told Fox News Digital.', 'Former President Trump, flanked by attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, arrives for his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on Wednesday. (Jabin Botsford/Pool via Reuters)', 'The charges against Trump in New York are related to alleged payments made ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 extramarital sexual encounter with Trump.', \"Prosecutors must convince the jury that not only did Trump falsify the business records related to alleged hush money payments, but that he did so in furtherance of another crime, conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. Bragg's allegation that Trump falsified records to cover up an additional crime elevated to a felony what otherwise would have been misdemeanor charges.\", 'Gelormino said that in 45 years of practicing criminal law in New York, he and his law partner have never seen a case like this.', '\"This is the most absurd, obscene case we\\'ve ever seen anybody try to get convicted of. And for this to be a case against the former president of the United States puts it way over the top,\" he said. \"Any citizen, anybody, should never be charged with these kind of crimes.\"', 'Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks during a news conference in New York City on March 7. (Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)', 'If Trump is convicted, he would still be able to run for president. But what that looks like will vary greatly depending on his sentence. An appeal could take months or even years to resolve. And an appellate court would decide whether to stay any sentence or conditions pending an appeal.', \"Prosecutors will have the option of requesting that presiding Judge Juan Merchan increase Trump's bail to guarantee his return for the sentencing hearing. This could also include a request for remand, which would place Trump in jail until his sentencing hearing. But legal experts say it is unlikely for a 77-year-old man who has never been convicted of a crime to be sent to jail.\", 'Gelormino explained that before sentencing, the former president would have to meet with a probation officer for an interview to create a pre-sentencing report for the judge. The report, which can take six to eight weeks to complete, would include a short biography of Trump and a recommended sentence. It would be sent to all parties, and the defense would have an opportunity to suggest its own sentencing terms. Merchan would not be bound by the sentencing report.', 'The Rikers Island jail complex stands with the Manhattan skyline in the background in New York on June 20, 2014. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)', 'Probation offices are located throughout New York City, but Gelormino guessed that authorities would make special arrangements for Trump so that a former president is not waiting for hours in a lobby with other convicts. Trump, like any other convict, would have to abide by certain rules as he awaits sentencing, including that he must admit guilt to the probation officer.', '\"When my clients have to meet with a probation officer, what the judges will tell you is you have to do three things. You have to stay out of trouble. You have to not get rearrested. And you have to tell the truth to the probation officer,\" Gelormino said. \"Meaning, they ask you about the incident, and every one of my clients that goes in there, I always tell them, \\'Just say to the probation officer you agree to what\\'s on the record because you have to admit guilt.\\'\"', 'If a convict found guilty by a jury of his peers does not admit guilt to the probation officer, Gelormino said, the judge will take that into account as an \"aggravating factor\" in sentencing.', 'Former President Trump returns from a lunch break for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on Tuesday. (Julia Nikhinson-Pool/Getty Images)', 'If Trump is sentenced to prison, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said the city\\'s Department of Corrections and the Rikers Island facility in New York are \"ready\" to receive him. Asked if Trump would be housed by himself or with the general population, a Department of Corrections spokesman said, \"The Department would find appropriate housing for him if he winds up in our custody.\" The department did not respond to additional questions.', 'Trump is enheadingd to Secret Service protection even if he is sent to prison. It is unclear how the Secret Service would coordinate with the court and correction officers to protect Trump if he is incarcerated.', '\"I don\\'t think anybody knows what that would look like, God forbid that happens,\" said Gelormino.', \"Another option is for Trump to be placed in home confinement at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence. New York and Florida officials would have to coordinate, but this would severely restrict Trump's ability to campaign for the White House, said David Gelman, a criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor based in New Jersey.\", '\"A defendant basically cannot leave their residence unless they have to meet with doctors or an attorney. Also, traveling would be off limits as well, which would be a tremendous form of election interference due to the fact President Trump needs to campaign in different states in the country leading up to the election,\" Gelman told Fox News Digital.', 'The third option is probation. In this case, the probation officer assigned to Trump would exert great power over the 2024 Republican nominee. Trump would have to request permission to travel out of state, for example, which would greatly hinder his ability to campaign. He could also be subject to searches, surprise visits and be forced to attend meetings at any time.', 'Gelormino said there is \"absolutely\" a risk that a politically motivated probation officer could abuse his or her power over Trump to keep him from campaigning.', '\"Probation officers tend, at least in New York City… to be Democrats because it\\'s a position that\\'s politically motivated at the best of times,\" he said.', 'Trump has already referred to his New York case as a \"witch hunt\" led by Democrats and Judge Merchan as a \"conflicted\" judge in comments to reporters during his trial. Claiming unfair treatment by a probation officer with bad motivations would not be out of character for the GOP nominee.', 'If Trump wins the election despite his conviction, he will not be able to pardon himself, since this is a state case. How a sitting president of the United States could abide by the terms of his sentence after conviction for state crimes is unprecedented and unknown legal territory.', \"The other possibilities are that the jury is unable to reach a verdict and the case ends in a mistrial. Gelormino said, in New York, prosecutors typically will move to retry a case within two or three months, unless they can reach an agreement with the defense for a resolution that avoids trial. That outcome seems unlikely given Bragg's zealous prosecution and Trump's defiant proclamations of innocence.\", 'Former President Trump appears during a campaign event at Crotona Park in the Bronx, New York, on Thursday. (Bing Guan/Bloomberg via Getty Images)', 'If Trump is found not guilty, New York City Councilman Joe Borelli, a Republican, said the president would be wise to move on. Borelli helped the Trump campaign acquire the necessary permits to hold a rally in the Bronx last week that attracted 10,000 people, according to law enforcement.', '\"I think he should just forget about it, move on and let his surrogates talk about the criminal prosecutions while he\\'s doing what we saw him do here in New York, which is actually attracting and expanding his base,\" said Borelli.', 'However, Gelormino said Trump would have an excellent case to \"turn around and sue everybody involved\" in the prosecution if he wanted to take the litigious route. ', '\"I think he\\'s got a damn good case for malicious prosecution from DA Bragg\\'s office. And I also think he would bring what\\'s called an Article 78 proceeding against the judge for malfeasance in his job,\" Gelormino said. \"I don\\'t know if that would have as much legs as the malicious prosecution case against the DA. But I\\'d imagine that, knowing Trump, and knowing how tenacious he is, that he intends to bring something if he is acquitted.\"', \"Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\"",

        "article": "Need the TL;DR on Tuesday’s marathon closing arguments? PBS NewsHour’s William Brangham helped explain what was said, plus find live updates from court yesterday, dueling news conferences from the Biden and Trump campaigns, and an update from one of Donald Trump’s other criminal cases.', 'NEW YORK (AP) — The first day of jury deliberations in Donald Trump’s criminal hush money trial concluded after the panel sent their first two notes to the judge Wednesday afternoon, just a few hours after beginning deliberations.', 'They requested to rehear jury instructions, as well as rehear testimony from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where he agreed to identify negative stories for Trump, a phone call he says he had with Trump about the Karen McDougal deal, and his decision not to sell the rights to McDougal’s story to Trump.', 'Trump’s 2024 trials: Where they stand and what to expect', 'The jury also asked to hear Michael Cohen’s testimony about the same Trump Tower meeting.', 'Judge Juan M. Merchan said it would take some time to gather the requested testimony and about a half hour to re-read it to the jury. Deliberations will resume Thursday morning.', 'The historic deliberations followed Tuesday’s whirlwind of closing arguments, which stretched into the evening as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Trump of intentionally deceiving voters by allegedly participating in a “catch-and-kill” scheme to bury stories that might obliterate his 2016 presidential bid.', 'The defense approached its summation much in the same way it approached cross-examination: by targeting the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen.', 'Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.', 'READ MORE: Guilty or not guilty, Trump verdict won’t sway most voters, poll shows', 'At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.', 'Prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as “legal expenses” to hide the true nature of the transactions.', 'The case is the first of Trump’s four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president.', 'Donald Trump continued to complain about the hush money trial as he left court Wednesday after the first day of jury deliberations.', '“The judge ought to end it and save his reputation,” Trump told reporters after conferring with his campaign and legal teams.', 'The former president also railed that “a lot of key witnesses were not called,” even though his side ultimately chose to call only two witnesses to testify.', 'He said again it’s “very unfair” that he has to be in court instead of out campaigning” and again labeled the case “a Biden witch hunt” and “weaponization.”', 'Court in Donald Trump’s hush money case has adjourned for the day. Proceedings will resume on Thursday at 9:30 a.m.', 'Judge Juan M. Merchan has returned to the bench in the Manhattan courtroom where Donald Trump’s hush money trial is being held.', 'Trump is also back in the courtroom.', '“OK, where do we stand?” Merchan asked the lawyers, who have been sifting through trial transcripts to isolate portions requested by the jury.', 'After going through areas of agreement about how to respond to some of the jury’s requests, the two sides are now asking the judge to settle disagreements about exactly which lines of David Pecker’s testimony about the Trump Tower meeting will be read to the jurors.', 'Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said the testimony that jurors want read aloud to them involves “a lot of little snippets that are not very long,” but a total of about 35 pages.', 'One reason why the process of gathering requested testimony for the jury is somewhat painstaking is that witnesses aren’t always asked about events in one fell swoop.', 'Sometimes lawyers will return to a topic at different points in their questioning, and the same events can be covered again and again on direct examination and cross-examination. One of the goals of sifting through the transcripts is to ensure that no relevant testimony is left out.', 'The lawyers also want to make sure that testimony they feel isn’t relevant to the jury’s request is left out of whatever is read back to the panel. Opposing sides often debate what is and isn’t pertinent.', 'With Donald Trump gone from the courtroom, a pair of prosecutors and a pair of defense lawyers in his hush money case huddled Wednesday afternoon around the defense table poring over hard copies of the transcripts.', 'Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass leaned over a thick, bound transcript, reading through lines as his colleague Susan Hoffinger jotted notes on a notepad. Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove stood at their spots at the defense table, reading through yet more transcripts and conferring with their opposite numbers. At one point, Steinglass looked up from his volume and flashed a broad smile at Blanche, who reacted in kind — a moment of collegiality among courtroom rivals.', 'Judge Juan M.

All they have with them is a verdict sheet and a laptop loaded with documents and other exhibits presented in the case.', 'The panel can’t have any of the transcripts of testimony in the case while deliberating, nor can they be given a written copy of the instructions that were read to them Wednesday morning.', 'Instead, the panel must send a note to the judge each time it wants to have a snippet of testimony read out or get a refresher on the instructions it must follow.', 'The jury in Donald Trump’s hush money trial has made four requests in a note to the judge.', 'It wants to hear former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker’s testimony regarding the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where he agreed to identify negative stories for Trump, a phone call he says he had with Trump about the Karen McDougal deal, and his decision not to sell the rights to McDougal’s story to Trump.', 'READ MORE: Jury in historic Trump hush money trial to begin deliberations', 'The jury also wants to hear Michael Cohen’s testimony about the same Trump Tower meeting.', 'Judge Juan M.

The note’s articles have not yet been made public but will be read in court soon. The jury, which is deliberating in secret in a side room, indicated it had a note by ringing a courtroom bell at 2:56 p.m., about 3½ hours into deliberations.', 'While deliberating, juries can only communicate with the judge by note. They may involve questions such as requests to hear portions of testimony or rehear certain instructions.', 'Donald Trump’s complaints on social media about the hush money case persisted Wednesday as the jury deliberated.', '“IT IS RIDICULOUS, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND UNAMERICAN that the highly Conflicted, Radical Left Judge is not requiring a unanimous decision on the fake charges against me brought by Soros backed D.A. Alvin Bragg,” he wrote. “A THIRD WORLD ELECTION INTERFERENCE HOAX!”', 'Despite his declaration, any verdict in the case has to be unanimous: guilty or not guilty.', 'If the jurors disagree, they keep deliberating. If they get to a point where they are hopelessly deadlocked, then the judge can declare a mistrial.', 'If they convict, they must agree that Trump created a false entry in his company’s records or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of committing or concealing another crime — in this case, violating a state election law.', 'What the jurors do not have to agree on, however, is which way that election law was violated.', 'Justice Juan Merchan instructs the jury before deliberations during Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump’s criminal trial over charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, at Manhattan state court in New York City, U.S. May 29, 2024 in this courtroom sketch. Photo by Jane Rosenberg/Reuters', 'Jurors in Donald Trump’s criminal trial will deliberate as long as they need to.', 'The standard court day runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a break for lunch. But judges sometimes extend the hours if jurors wish. In this case, Judge Juan M. Merchan already has decided that deliberations will proceed on Wednesday, which is normally a day off from the trial.', 'There’s no limit on how many days deliberations can continue.', 'As jury deliberations get underway in Donald Trump’s hush money trial, the White House says President Joe Biden’s attention is focused elsewhere.', '“The president’s focused on the American people, delivering for the American people,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden to Philadelphia, where he has campaign events scheduled Wednesday. “That’s his focus.”', 'As the jury begins its deliberations in Donald Trump’s hush money case, claims are spreading across social media that Judge Juan M. Merchan told the panel they don’t need a unanimous verdict to convict Trump.', 'That’s false.', 'To convict Trump, Merchan told the jury they will have to find unanimously — that is, all 12 jurors must agree — that the former president created a fraudulent entry in his company’s records or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of committing or concealing another crime.', 'What’s being distorted by some online is the judge’s instruction about how to reach a verdict about that second element.', 'Prosecutors say the crime Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators “to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.”', 'Merchan gave the jurors three possible “unlawful means”: falsifying other business records, breaking the Federal Election Campaign Act or submitting false information on a tax return.', 'For a conviction, each juror would have to find that at least one of those three things happened, but they don’t have to agree unanimously which it was.', 'The jury in Donald Trump’s hush money case will deliberate through the lunch hour, but no action will occur and no notes will be passed during the break. Court will resume at 2:15 p.m.', 'Jurydeliberations proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and through an intentionally opaque process.', 'Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it’s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.', 'It’s anyone’s guess how long the jury in Donald Trump’s hush money case will deliberate for and there’s no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records and that could take some time. A verdict might not come by the end of the week.', 'To reach a verdict on any given count, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.', 'Things will get trickier if the jury can’t reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Judge Juan M. Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.', 'If, after that instruction, the jury still can’t reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.', 'Former President Donald Trump told reporters after jurors began deliberating in his criminal hush money trial that the charges were rigged and again accused the judge of being conflicted. He further said that “Mother Teresa could not beat these charges.”', '“What is happening here is weaponization at a level that nobody’s seen before ever and it shouldn’t be allowed to happen,” Trump said.', 'Trump repeated accusations that the criminal charges were brought by President Joe Biden’s administration to hit him, as the president’s main election opponent.', 'After jurors left the courtroom to begin deliberations, Judge Juan M. Merchan told Donald Trump and his lawyers that they were required to remain in the courthouse.', '“You cannot leave the building. We need you to be able to get here quickly if we do receive a note,” Merchan said.', 'After Merchan left the bench, Trump turned and walked to chat with his son, Donald Trump Jr. and lawyer Alina Habba.', 'After the main jury in Donald Trump’s hush money case left the courtroom Wednesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan told the six alternates who remain in the courtroom that they will remain on standby in the courthouse as deliberations get underway.', 'He thanked them for their service and diligence, noting he saw one of the alternates go through three notebooks.', 'He said, “There might be a need for you at some point in deliberations.”', 'The alternates will be kept separate from the main jury and must also surrender their phones to court officers while deliberations are in progress.

Prosecutors must also prove that Trump did so with the intent to commit or conceal another crime.', 'Prosecutors allege the other crime that Trump intended to commit or conceal was a violation of a state election law regarding a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election by unlawful means.', 'The alleged unlawful means that jurors must consider are:', 'In reading instructions to the jury in Donald Trump’s criminal trial, Judge Juan M. Merchan also went over New York’s law against “conspiracy to promote or prevent election,” a statute that’s important to the case.', 'Prosecutors claim that Trump falsified business records to cover up alleged violations of the election conspiracy law. The alleged violations, prosecutors say, were hush money payments that really amounted to illegal campaign contributions.', 'Under New York law, it’s a misdemeanor for two or more people to conspire to promote or prevent a candidate’s election “by unlawful means” if at least one of the conspirators takes action to carry out the plot.', 'The judge noted that the law also requires that a defendant have the intent unlawfully to prevent or promote the candidate’s election — not just that a defendant knows about the conspiracy or be present when it’s discussed.', 'In the defense’s closing argument Tuesday, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged jurors to reject prosecutors’ election conspiracy assertions, insisting that “every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate.”', 'Judge Juan M. Merchan instructed jurors on the concept of accessorial liability, under which a defendant can be held criminally responsible for someone else’s actions.', 'That’s a key component of the prosecution’s theory of Donald Trump’s hush money case because while Trump signed some of the checks at issue, people working for his company processed Michael Cohen’s invoices and entered the transactions into its accounting system.', 'To hold Trump liable for those actions, Merchan said jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he solicited, requested or commanded those people to engage in that conduct and that he acted intentionally.', 'READ MORE: In hush money trial, witness Michael Cohen says, ‘Everything required Mr. Trump’s sign-off’', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass touched on accessorial liability in his closing argument Tuesday, telling jurors: “No one is saying the defendant actually got behind a computer and typed in the false vouchers or stamped the false invoices or printed the false checks.”', '“But he set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of the false business records,” Steinglass said.', 'Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.', 'The judge in Donald Trump’s criminal trial gave the jury some guidance on factors it can use to assess witness testimony, including its plausibility, its consistency with other testimony, the witness’s manner on the stand and whether the person has a motive to lie.', 'But, the judge said, “There is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of another person’s statement.”', 'WATCH: How Trump’s legal team is trying to ruin Michael Cohen’s credibility in hush money trial', 'The principles he outlined are standard but perhaps all the more relevant after Trump’s defense team leaned heavily on questioning the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, including the ex-president’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.', 'Jurors appeared alert and engaged as Judge Juan M.

Merchan said, underscoring that — in the eyes of the law — the jurors and Trump are peers.', 'Merchan also reminded jurors of their vow, during jury selection, “to set aside any personal bias you may have in favor of or against” Trump and decide the case “fairly based on the evidence of the law.”', 'Echoing standard jury instructions, Merchan noted that even though the defense presented evidence, the burden of proof remains on the prosecutor and that Trump is “not required to prove that he is not guilty.”', '“In fact,” noted Merchan, “the defendant is not required to prove or disprove anything.”', 'The jury in Donald Trump’s hush money trial has entered the courtroom and taken their seats. Ahead of deliberations, Judge Juan M.

Merchan barred him from defending himself by claiming that his alleged actions were taken on the advice of his then-lawyer, Cohen. Trump’s lawyers in March notified the court that they would not rely on that defense.', '“THERE WAS NO CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE BUM THAT GOT CAUGHT STEALING FROM ME!” Trump said, apparently referring to Cohen. He added: “IN GOD WE TRUST!”', 'Trump is prohibited under a gag order from making out-of-court statements about witnesses in the case, and he was previously penalized for comments about Cohen.', 'It’s unclear if Trump’s latest rant would rise to the level of a violation — or if prosecutors would seek to have the former president sanctioned for it.

Court was expected to continue much longer than usual — to as late as 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.', 'Jurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might have threatened Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.', 'Trump’s 2024 trials: Where they stand and what to expect', 'At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was given to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.', 'Prosecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump’s then-lawyer, were falsely logged as “legal expenses” to hide the true nature of the transactions.', 'Trump has denied all wrongdoing.', 'He pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.', 'Closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.', 'The case is the first of Trump’s four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.', 'The other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It’s unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass finished his summation by imploring jurors to find Donald Trump guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records.', '“Donald Trump can’t shoot someone on Fifth Avenue at rush hour and get away with it,” Steinglass said, parroting Trump’s own long ago remark, prompting an objection from Trump’s lawyer. The objection was sustained.', 'During his closing remarks, Steinglass had sprinted — and, at times, staggered — through the timeline of events covered during Donald Trump’s hush money trial, repeating many of the points he’s already made, albeit with more emphatic takeaways.', 'As the judge’s 8 p.m. deadline was minutes away, Steinglass acknowledged his summation had been “really long.”', '“I apologize for trading brevity for thoroughness,” he told jurors, “but we only get one shot at this.”', 'Steinglass spoke for over five hours. Todd Blanche, Trump’s defense attorney, went for about three.', 'Judge Juan Merchan told jurors he’ll give them instructions Wednesday before they start deliberating. Court will start at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the judge said, noting the long day on Tuesday. He said court will go until 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday and that they’ll revisit scheduling and the length of days as the week goes on.', 'Jurors appeared resilient but relieved to be going home as they marched out of the courtroom after the marathon day of summations.', 'Following the longer-than-usual day in the courtroom, the former president didn’t give his usual post-court remarks to the press in the hallway.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass showed jurors a series of Donald Trump’s social media posts lashing out at his former lawyer Michael Cohen after Cohen defected, which the prosecutor argued were not only designed to punish the former fixer, but to signal to other potential witnesses: “cooperate and you will face the wrath of Donald Trump.”', 'He also cited lawsuits Trump had filed against Cohen and Daniels as other examples of intimidation.', '“The defendant wanted everyone to see the cost of taking him on,” Steinglass said.', 'A related argument, regarding threats Daniels said she faced after going public, prompted Trump’s lawyers to object. Defense lawyer Todd Blanche called it “extraordinarily prejudicial.” Steinglass stressed that he wasn’t suggesting Trump was behind the threats, but Judge Juan Merchan told him to move along anyway.', 'The sides argued briefly over that issue while the jury was out of the courtroom for the final recess.', 'But the day wasn’t over. The prosecution’s summation, which began around 2 p.m., was still going as of 7 p.m.', 'Merchan told Steinglass he’s facing a hard out at 8 p.m. All day, jurors have said they can work until that time, but not later, the judge said. Merchan suggested the lawyer have his colleagues give him a note to indicate when it reaches that time so he can then wrap up his statement.', '“Thanks for sticking with me,” Steinglass tells jurors as he settled back in at the podium after the break.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass seems to be trying to stay on the good sides of the jury — and to be cognizant of the length of his presentation, which had stretched into a fourth hour Tuesday evening.', '“I know what you’re thinking: Is this guy going to go through every single month’s worth of checks?” he quipped at one point as he ran through ledger after ledger.', 'He’s also tried to pepper his closing with occasional humor.', 'At one point, as he talked about how much money Michael Cohen was making, he said Trump’s former lawyer and fixer “was making way more money than any government job would ever pay.”', '“And don’t I know that,” he added.', 'The aside drew smiles and chuckles from some of the jurors.', 'As the clock neared 6:30 p.m., Steinglass paused, asking the judge if he should “power through” or stop. After a bench conference, Steinglass returned to the podium and asked jurors: “You good to go a little bit longer?”', 'They appeared amenable, to which the prosecutor replied with a satisfied: “Alright.”', 'During closing arguments in Donald Trump’s hush money trial Tuesday, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Michael Cohen did little work for Trump in 2017, despite the checks he was receiving.', 'Trump’s lawyers contend the payments were for legal services Cohen provided that year. Steinglass pointed to Cohen testifying he did only about 10 hours of legal work that year.', '“Mr. Cohen spent more time being cross-examined at this trial than he did doing legal work for Donald Trump in 2017,” Steinglass quipped. “Do you think there’s any chance Donald Trump would pay $42,000 an hour for legal work by Michael Cohen?”', 'Steinglass seized on a 2018 Trump tweet in which the then-president described the arrangement with Cohen as “reimbursement” while insisting it was unrelated to Trump’s candidacy.', '“Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA,” Trump wrote at the time.', 'Steinglass said that while the payments didn’t come out of campaign funds, “the payment has everything to do with the campaign.”', '“And yet they still try to argue that the payments to Cohen in 2017 were for legal services rendered — because to say anything else is to admit that the business records were false, and they can’t do that,” the prosecutor said of his counterparts at the defense table.', 'Steinglass said the defense’s characterization of the payments to Cohen is also undermined by the fact that Trump didn’t pay Cohen anything in 2018, despite Cohen performing legal work for Trump that year.', 'The prosecutor also argued it would be “crazy” to think former Trump company finance chief Allen Weisselberg and Cohen devised the payment plan on their own. Trump surely would have asked questions about the $35,000 checks to Cohen that came to him to sign, the prosecutor asserted.', '“Don’t buy this bogus narrative that the defense is selling — that the defendant was too busy to know what he was signing,” Steinglass urged jurors. “The defendant’s entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything, down to negotiating the price of the light bulbs.”', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass turned from the hush money arrangements before the 2016 election to the alleged effort to mask Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payout as closing arguments resumed Tuesday in Donald Trump’s trial in New York.', 'Steinglass argued the case has “smoking guns” — in the form of handwritten jottings by former Trump company finance chief Allen Weisselberg and ex-controller Jeffrey McConney.', 'The two documents show calculations related to the payments Cohen got in 2017. They included his reimbursement for the $130,000 he’d paid Daniels, as well as an unrelated reimbursement, a bonus, and money to cover taxes, according to testimony.', 'While the defense suggested that Cohen was the driving force in the decision to style the payments as fees for legal services, the Weisselberg and McConney notes are “overt manifestations” that that’s not so, the prosecutor argued.', '“They are the smoking guns. They completely blow out of the water” the defense’s claims that the payments were for legal work, Steinglass said.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche sits with Donald Trump as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass presents closing arguments on May 28, 2024. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/ Reuters', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass stressed late Tuesday afternoon that to understand the hush money case against Donald Trump, jurors needed to understand the climate in which the deal to pay off Stormy Daniels was made — just after the “Access Hollywood” tape leak had “caused pandemonium in the Trump campaign.”', '“It’s critical to appreciate this,” Steinglass said.', 'At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as “locker room talk,” Trump “was negotiating to muzzle a porn star,” the prosecutor said.', '“Stormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant wasn’t only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy of spinning away the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape,” Steinglass said.', 'Court in Donald Trump’s hush money trial recessed for a 20-minute break just before 5 p.m. Tuesday.', 'Before sending jurors out of the courtroom, Judge Juan M. Merchan thanked them for making arrangements to stay later than usual. He said some jurors made child care and other arrangements allowing them to stay until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.', '“I think right now we’re going to try to finish this out tonight,” he said.', 'The judge also noted that all of the jurors still looked alert. “I don’t think we’re losing anyone,” he observed.', 'While Manhattan famously has a night court that handles arraignments — first court appearances of those recently arrested — it’s unusual for state court trials there to run as late as 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. Merchan has been consulting with high-level court security officers, among others, about the plan.', 'The prosecution’s closing argument in Donald Trump’s hush money case stretched into its third hour Tuesday afternoon as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass recapped the details of the back-and-forth between Stormy Daniels’ representatives and Michael Cohen over the payoff deal.', 'Steinglass supplemented his detailed recitation with phone records, text messages, encrypted communications and excerpts of testimony, seemingly trying to reinforce his theme that there’s a “mountain” of corroboration for the allegations at hand.', 'Meanwhile, Trump is taking in this leg of the summation with his head back and his eyes closed — a strategy he’s employed throughout the trial.', 'Following a brief afternoon break in closing arguments in Donald Trump’s hush money trial, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass turned his attention to the publication of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in October 2016 and the resulting fallout for the then-candidate’s campaign.', 'Steinglass reminded jurors how Hope Hicks, then the campaign’s communications director, testified that news coverage of the tape knocked a Category 4 hurricane out of the headlines.', 'Steinglass dubbed the tape a “Category 5” hurricane.', 'The prosecution on Tuesday targeted the defense’s efforts to cast doubt on a September 2016 recording that Michael Cohen made of a conversation with Donald Trump in which the two are allegedly heard discussing a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story from the National Enquirer.', 'Steinglass said the defense had gone to “laughable lengths” to try to undermine the recording, which he cast as “nothing short of jaw-dropping.”', 'Cohen had testified during the hush money trial that the recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, was interrupted when he received an incoming call.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche had tried to cast the recording as unreliable and suggested it was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding — not McDougal.', 'Blanche also questioned whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said on Tuesday during closing arguments that joking texts between Karen McDougal’s lawyer Keith Davidson and then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard about hypothetical ambassadorships were clear evidence that they knew the deal would benefit Trump’s presidential campaign.', '“Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I’m thinking Isle of Mann,” Davidson wrote on July 28, 2016, referring to the British territory Isle of Man.', '“I’m going to Make Australia Great Again,” replied Howard, who hails from Australia.', 'All joking aside, Steinglass said: “It’s a palpable recognition of what they’re doing. They’re helping Trump get elected.” The prosecutor said the text messages underscore that “Trump is looming behind everything that they’re doing.”', 'Digging further into the two sides’ dispute over the “catch-and-kill” allegations, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said during closing arguments Tuesday that it doesn’t matter that Karen McDougal preferred a deal that would help her career while not airing her claims of an affair with Donald Trump, as her former lawyer and others testified.', '“Her motivations are totally irrelevant. The question is: What is the defendant’s motivation?” the prosecutor said, adding that that motivation “was to serve the campaign.”', 'Trump denies any sexual involvement with McDougal.', 'Batting back defense lawyer Todd Blanche’s argument that “every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate,” prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said during closing arguments that Trump’s alleged efforts to suppress negative stories that might hurt his 2016 White House bid were no different.', 'The purpose of the effort, Steinglass argued, was “to manipulate and defraud the voters, to pull the wool over their eyes in a coordinated fashion.”', 'Steinglass went on to call the National Enquirer’s work in that area on Trump’s behalf “one of the most valuable contributions that anyone ever made to the Trump campaign.”', '“This scheme, cooked up by these three men, could very well be what got President Trump elected,” Steinglass said.', 'Steinglass also pushed back on Blanche’s articleion that the National Enquirer’s deal to bury the Trump Tower doorman’s bogus story wasn’t a form of catch and kill.', 'Steinglass noted that the tabloid amended its source agreement with doorman Dino Sajudin so that he would be paid the agreed upon $30,000 fee within five days of signing the document — instead of upon publication of the story, as had been previously drafted.', '“The only reason to kill a bogus story,” certainly wasn’t to act in a financially responsible fashion or satisfy the tabloid’s investors, Steinglass argued, but to be “in service of the defendant’s campaign.”', 'After Donald Trump’s lawyer had insisted to jurors that the hush money case rested on Michael Cohen and that they couldn’t trust him, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass sought to persuade the group that there is “a mountain of evidence, of corroborating testimony, that tends to connect the defendant to this crime.”', 'He pointed to testimony from David Pecker and others, to the recorded conversation in which Trump and Cohen appear to discuss the Karen McDougal deal, and to Trump’s own tweets.', '“It’s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It’s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It’s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,” Steinglass said.', 'The prosecutor then accused the defense of wanting to make the case all about Cohen.', '“It isn’t. That’s a deflection,” he said. “This case is not about Michael Cohen. It’s about Donald Trump.”', 'While the defense in Donald Trump’s hush money case portrayed Michael Cohen as a lying opportunist who has profited off his hatred of Trump. prosecutors suggested in their closing arguments that the disbarred attorney had little choice but to parlay his history with Trump into books, a podcast, merchandise and more.', '“I’m not asking you to feel bad for Michael Cohen. He made his bed,” Steinglass told jurors. “But you can hardly blame him for making money from the one thing he has left, which is his knowledge of the inner workings of the Trump Organization.”', 'The prosecutor later elaborated: “We didn’t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn’t pick him up at the witness store.”', '“The defendant chose Michael Cohen to be his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on the defendant’s behalf,” he added.', 'The prosecution on Tuesday homed in on Stormy Daniels’ sometimes “cringeworthy” testimony about a 2006 sexual encounter she says she had with Donald Trump, saying it was vital because it “only reinforces his incentive to buy her silence.”', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass added that Daniels’ account of meeting up with Trump in his Lake Tahoe hotel suite — replete with details of the décor and what she saw when she snooped in Trump’s toiletry kit — was full of touchstones “that kind of ring true.”', '“Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that’s kind of the point,” Steinglass said.', 'He told jurors: “In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.”', '“We don’t have to prove that sex actually took place, but the defendant knew what happened in that hotel room and the extent that you credit her testimony, that only reinforces his incentive to buy her silence,” Steinglass argued.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass on Tuesday afternoon tried in his summation to counter the defense’s efforts to discredit Michael Cohen’s testimony.', 'He said that the jury should take Cohen’s past dishonesty into account.', '“How could you not?” he asked.', 'But he says that Cohen’s anger is understandable given that, “To date, he’s the only one that’s paid the price for his role in this conspiracy.”', 'Cohen, Steinglass argued, did Trump’s bidding for years, was his right-hand man, and when things went bad, was cut loose and thrown under the bus.', '“Anyone in Cohen’s shoes would want the defendant to be held accountable,” he argued.', 'At the outset of its summation in Donald Trump’s hush money trial, the prosecution sought to rebut the defense’s claim that adult film actor actor Stormy Daniels was trying to “extort” the then-presidential candidate.', 'Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass noted that Daniels’ representatives initially sought to sell the story of a sexual encounter between the porn actor and Trump to media outlets — not to Trump. Steinglass also cited Daniels’ testimony that she came to believe that going public was the best way to protect herself and her family from pressure to stay silent.', 'WATCH: Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 first responders speak outside Trump’s hush money trial', 'Regardless, allegations of extortion are “not a defense to election fraud,” the prosecutor said.', '“You don’t get to commit election fraud or falsify business records because you believe you’ve been victimized,” he told jurors.', 'Justice Juan Merchan presides as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass presents closing arguments during Donald Trump’s criminal trial on May 28, 2024.

He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.', '“This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,” Steinglass said as he began.', 'Prosecutors have presented “powerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt,” he said.', 'As he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.', 'Donald Trump’s children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen “the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.”', 'He said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a “political persecution” and in using one of his father’s frequent terms, called it a “witch hunt.”', '“This is a sham.

Merchan scolded Blanche. “Someone who’s been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It’s simply not allowed. Period.”', 'If Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.', 'Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It’s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case “isn’t a referendum on your views of President Trump.”', '“This is not a referendum on the ballot box — who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,” the attorney told jurors. “The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,” and nothing else, he reminds them.', 'He implored the jury to return a quick “not guilty” verdict.', 'As he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen’s admitted fixation on Donald Trump — and his desire to see him behind bars.', 'Blanche played short clips of Cohen’s podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges “fills me with delight.”', 'The case against Trump is built around testimony from “a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,” Blanche said.', 'Donald Trump’s children — Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — and daughter-in-law Lara sit nearby the former president as defense lawyer Todd Blanche presents closing arguments in his hush money case.

He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,” he said.', 'Trump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution’s narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as “catch and kill.”', 'Cohen had known about Daniels’ claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.', '“Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?” Blanche asked.', 'Cohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the “Access Hollywood” tape.', 'Blanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through “catch and kill.”', 'The National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn’t interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn’t be corroborated.', 'Pecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn’t want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.', 'Blanche suggested the publisher didn’t want anything to do with the story anyway.', '“That’s our conspiracy?

Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.”', 'After arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.', 'Michael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president’s hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income — taxes that wouldn’t apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.', '“That is absurd,” Blanche told jurors, pointing to “all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.”', 'Biden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump’s trial', 'Joe Biden’s campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump’s hush money trial is happening.', 'Speaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to “destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.”', 'As he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.', '“It matters where President Trump was,” Blanche said.', 'He noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.', 'Blanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. “That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,” he said.', 'About an hour into the defense’s closing arguments in Donald Trump’s hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution’s use of excerpts from Trump’s books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.', 'The books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.', '“You should be suspicious. That’s a red flag,” Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution’s closing.', 'Blanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump’s assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump’s personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.', '“This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,” Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump’s assets were put under the trust’s control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn’t in charge, he added.', 'At one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization’s day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.', 'Blanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren’t called to the witness stand.', 'A key part of prosecutors’ claims in Donald Trump’s hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn’t being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.', 'While Cohen characterized that work as “very minimal,” Blanche argued otherwise.', 'Donald Trump appears with his lawyers Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and Susan Necheles on May 28, 2024.

None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.', 'Insisting that prosecutors haven’t proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they “should want and expect more” than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen’s testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels’ former lawyer Keith Davidson.', 'Blanche argued that Davidson “was really just trying to extort money from President Trump” in the lead-up to the 2016 election.', '“The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,” Blanche said.', 'Blanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he’ll come up repeatedly throughout the defense’s summation.', '“You’re going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,” Blanche said. Cohen “told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,” the lawyer added.', 'Defense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump “is innocent” of the charges against him.', '“He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,” Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case “should leave you wanting.”', '“This case is about documents. It’s a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,” Blanche said. “Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.”', 'Jurors in Donald Trump’s criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M.

        "heading": "Why this tornado season has been so unusual — and it’s not even halfway over",
        "article": "Swarms of tornadoes have been tearing across the United States for nearly a month straight, keeping meteorologists and the public on guard for weeks. It’s been the most active May for severe weather since 2011 and has featured violent tornadoes, a 100 mph downburst that tore through Houston and even hail larger than grapefruits.', '1/3', 'Tornadoes touched down on all but two days between April 25 and May 27 — that’s 94 percent of days. That beats out other exceptionally active stretches in recent memory — such as in 2017, 2019 and 2022 — when between 88 percent and 91 percent of days had tornadoes.', 'Eight days during the recent spate netted 40 or more reported tornadoes, with more than 100 filtered tornado reports on April 26. At least three dozen people have been killed by tornadoes in 2024, including 23 since May 1.', 'The extreme season is the result of a stagnant weather pattern that has sent a barrage of disturbances barreling across the central states. Each has whipped up a slew of rotating thunderstorms or supercells, cranking out tornadoes from the High Plains to the East Coast.', 'Now, after a trying month meteorologically, a large-scale pattern change could spell a drop-off in tornado activity into next week.', 'May is typically the most active month of the year for tornadoes in the Lower 48. That’s because of a seasonal clash of air masses. As summer’s warmth tries to build northward — and bring along Gulf of Mexico humidity — it encounters lingering pockets of winter’s chill that surge southeast out of Canada. The colliding air masses brew strong to severe thunderstorms, and strong winds aloft in the jet stream sculpt them into spinning supercells.', 'By late spring, the highest concentration of tornadoes usually shifts from the Deep South to the southern Plains. That creates a bull’s eye over Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. A lesser, albeit considerable, risk also stretches westward to the edge of the Rockies, northward toward the southern Great Lakes, then east through most of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and South.', 'For the most part, this month’s storminess has hit in typically prone areas. That said, northern zones like Nebraska, Iowa and parts of the Ohio Valley have seen an unusually high tornado count for this early in the season.', 'Across the Deep South, namely Mississippi and Alabama, the spring tornado season was unusually quiet. The National Weather Service in Birmingham, for example, has issued only four tornado warnings this year — the fewest for this date since at least 1987. By this time last year, it had issued 44, and 175 through this date in 2011. The Jackson, Miss., office has issued just 19 tornado warnings, its fewest since 1986.', 'That’s typical of an El Niño winter, when the jet stream — a river of swiftly moving winds in the upper atmosphere — dives farther south over North America. That allows cooler air to spill all the way down to the Gulf Coast, shunting any severe weather risk into the Gulf of Mexico or Florida.', 'But in the late spring, the El Niño climate pattern wore off quickly, making way for a burgeoning La Niña. That sudden transition is rare, but historically it has been associated with above-average tornado activity over the Plains.', 'We’ve also had a favorable jet stream pattern. That jet stream has dipped in the west, producing a “trough” of low pressure. And the trough has been spitting out smaller “shortwave” disturbances seemingly nonstop to trigger storms.', 'The same jet stream has also been surging over the Gulf Coast states, allowing warmth and moisture to waft northward. That makes for a reservoir of storm fuel.', 'Each storm system has either used up or scoured out most of the available storm fuel over the Plains, but persistent “return flow,” or southerly flow in the wake of storm systems, has helped the atmosphere to reload gulf moisture time and time again. That has meant back-to-back tornado outbreaks can occur on consecutive days — like on April 26, when 108 reported tornadoes occurred across Nebraska and Iowa, followed by 51 preliminary tornadoes on the evening of April 27. Among them was an EF4 in Marietta, Okla., on the 0-to-5 Enhanced Fujita intensity scale, and multiple EF3s that claimed lives in Sulphur and Holdenville, Okla.', 'When those factors are added together, it’s no surprise the tornado season has been hyperactive. As far as textbook tornado setups go, this month has had a lot of them.', 'The stretch from April 26 to May 26 has been the deadliest such window since 2014, when 34 people died because of tornadoes. Otherwise, the past eight years (from 2015 to 2023) had 30 deaths total during the same time frame.', 'The 23 tornado deaths in May is also the most in the month since 2013, when 32 people died. That month featured the most recent confirmed EF5 tornado that struck Moore, Okla., on May 20, as well as the El Reno, Okla., tornado that killed renowned storm chaser Tim Samaras.', 'Though no individual tornadoes this year have resulted in a double-digit death toll, the sheer number of tornadoes that caused one or more deaths is notable. At least 14 killer tornadoes occurred between April 26 and May 26. That’s the third most on record for that time frame dating back to 1950.', 'Historically speaking, June is the second most active month for tornadoes in the United States. That’s around the time the greatest concentration of tornadoes shifts from Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas to Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakotas, particularly the High Plains.', 'There’s no reason to think that severe weather chances are going to suddenly flatline, but we do think that, at least briefly, the Plains should catch a breather. High pressure will become established in the western United States, with a bowling ball upper-level low in the east. That should induce northwesterly flow over the Plains, bringing cooler, drier air to the nation’s heartland and suppressing the warmth and moisture needed to get big storms. There will also be a dearth of large-scale “triggers.”', 'Still, smaller-scale setups can and will happen. And it’s likely that sprawling storm complexes called MCSs, or mesoscale convective systems, will occur nightly with strong winds and lots of lightning. But, at least temporarily, the chances of another tornado outbreak are limited.', 'In case it’s still not clear just how wild of a stretch this past month has been, here’s a recap by the numbers:', 'More than 1,250 tornado warnings were issued during the month-long stretch, in addition to more than 5,600 severe-thunderstorm warnings.', 'If all the warnings were placed side by side perfectly across the country, they would cover more than 100 percent of the land area. Oklahoma has had enough warnings to be covered seven times over, Iowa six times over, and Missouri five times over. Nearly 48 percent of both Oklahoma and Iowa has been placed under a tornado warning and instructed to shelter at least once this season. In Kansas, 99.5 percent of land has been encompassed in one or more severe thunderstorm warnings.', 'The National Weather Service in Norman, Okla., has been working to issue said warnings seemingly nonstop. It has drawn up more than 600 of them, including 133 tornado warnings. Dallas, Tulsa, Springfield, Mo., and Omaha are next in line to have issued the most warnings of any of the nation’s 122 Weather Service offices.', 'Between April 27 and May 26, five days have had PDS tornado watches issued, meaning it was a particularly dangerous situation. Those are bulletins cautioning residents that especially intense tornadoes might form and that they should have multiple ways to be notified of tornado warnings.', 'Between April 25 and May 27, 17 days had PDS tornado warnings, the most on record for that stretch. A whopping 104 of them were issued. PDS tornado warnings, which were nationally implemented in 2016,  are usually reserved for when a significant tornado is sighted visually or detected on radar.', 'Most sobering were the 14 tornado emergencies issued — a souped-up tornado warning only utilized during the most extreme tornado events. They are used to warn of an immediate life-or-death situation associated with a confirmed large, strong to violent and extremely dangerous tornado. Emergencies were issued in Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, Michigan, Alabama, Tennessee, Texas and Kentucky on seven days. Michigan’s was the first on record for the state.",

It even offered to give federal officials a kill switch that would shut the app down in the United States if they felt it remained a threat.', 'The Biden administration, however, went its own way. Officials declined the proposal, forfeiting potential influence over one of the world’s most popular apps in favor of a blunter option: a forced-sale law signed last month by President Biden that could lead to TikTok’s nationwide ban.', 'The government has never publicly explained why it rejected TikTok’s proposal, opting instead for a potentially protracted constitutional battle that many expect to end up before the Supreme Court. Since federal officials announced an investigation into TikTok in 2019, the app’s user base has doubled to more than 170 million U.S. accounts — including Biden’s reelection campaign.', 'But the extent to which the United States evaluated or disregarded TikTok’s proposal, known as Project Texas, is likely to be a core point of dispute in court, where TikTok and its owner, ByteDance, are challenging the sale-or-ban law as an “unconstitutional assertion of power.”', 'Summarized stories to quickly stay informed', 'How a paperwork glitch is hurting student loan borrowers’ credit scores', 'Babies exposed to peanuts less likely to be allergic years later, study says', 'Lawsuit says American Airlines kicked 8 Black men off plane, citing body odor', 'Most D.C.-area sports fans dislike or hate Commanders’ name, poll finds', 'The episode raises questions over whether the government, when presented with a way to address its concerns, chose instead to back an effort that would see the company sold to an American buyer, even though some of the issues officials have warned about — the opaque influence of its recommendation algorithm, the privacy of user data — probably would still be unresolved under new ownership.', '“The government essentially threw up its hands at the possibility of any kind of regulation or cybersecurity measure,” said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University law professor who researches international tech policy.', '“TikTok proposed this incredible array of protections, but none of it mattered,” he added. “In the government’s thinking, it wasn’t: ‘Can this app be protected?’ It was: ‘There’s a Chinese owner.’ That became the death knell. The government had a complete absence of faith in [its] ability to regulate technology platforms, because there might be some vulnerability that might exist somewhere down the line.”', 'A senior Biden administration official said in a statement that the administration “determined more than a year ago that the solution proposed by the parties at the time would be insufficient to address the serious national security risks presented. While we have consistently engaged with the company about our concerns and potential solutions, it became clear that divestment from its foreign ownership was and remains necessary.” The official declined to specify what made the plan insufficient.', 'In their legal challenge, TikTok and ByteDance argue the sale-or-ban law violates the First Amendment by suppressing a platform Americans use for information and self-expression. Courts traditionally evaluate such speech disputes on whether the government is pursuing a compelling state interest through the least-restrictive means possible.', 'The government, some legal experts said, probably will be asked to explain why Project Texas wasn’t a reasonable solution for its national security goals. The Biden administration hasn’t publicly detailed why the proposal was inadequate, saying only that the possibility of future Chinese data-gathering or propaganda merited an aggressive response.', 'In a statement, a Justice Department spokesperson said the law “addresses critical national security concerns in a manner that is consistent with the First Amendment and other constitutional limitations. We look forward to defending the legislation in court.”', 'Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said in a statement that the company has voluntarily subjected itself to rigorous examination, including opening its source code to outside inspectors for ongoing technical review. “No other entertainment or social media platform provides a similar level of third-party oversight, even though they employ large numbers of foreign nationals and have development centers around the world,” Seth said.', 'TikTok and ByteDance leaders prepared the plan as part of their negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, a group composed of officials from nine federal agencies that reviews business deals for national security concerns.', 'TikTok outlined its proposals in a draft “national security agreement” totaling more than 90 pages, a copy of which The Washington Post reviewed last year. That proposal would have bound the company contractually to government controls in exchange for the ability to stay online in the United States.', 'The deal included extensive provisions never before offered to the government by a private company — including TikTok’s U.S.-based peers in the tech industry, such as Google and Facebook.', 'The plan would have largely blocked ByteDance’s global executives, including in its Beijing headquarters, from decision-making authority over the U.S. operation and would have siloed most of the U.S. app’s functionality in a discrete subsidiary subject to Washington oversight.', 'An American board of directors shaped by federal authorities would have been empowered to scrutinize the company’s article-moderation decisions and data flows, the draft agreement said. It also would have offered a “shutdown option” that the government could use to suspend TikTok in the United States if the company broke its part of the deal.', 'The plan was drafted over months of meetings in consultation with CFIUS officials, who told TikTok that they were close to a final agreement, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks.', 'But shortly after TikTok submitted the proposal in August 2022, “CFIUS without explanation stopped engaging,” TikTok and ByteDance wrote in their legal petition to the appeals court. The companies said they “repeatedly asked why discussions had ended and how they might be restarted, but they did not receive a substantive response.” (The administration official contends that the administration told TikTok at the time that divestment was the only viable option.)', 'TikTok officials requested meetings with Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and other agency leaders, who declined, arguing that the company was already meeting with the appropriate officials, a U.S. official told The Post. Around that time, officials from the White House and Justice Department, including Monaco, were holding meetings with the forced-sale bill’s co-sponsors and other lawmakers critical of TikTok to offer advice on how they could draw up a bill that would survive a legal challenge, congressional members and staffers told The Post.', '“There was clearly a bait and switch that happened here,” said a person who observed but was not involved in either side of the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss what they had witnessed. “There was a 100-page national security agreement draft that was excruciatingly detailed. They went down the road and started building a lot of stuff to comply with that. Then at some point the government just changed its mind.”', 'Despite the lack of agreement from the government, TikTok adopted a number of the proposal’s components, saying in its legal filing that it has spent more than $2 billion to “resolve the very concerns publicly expressed by [the law’s] congressional supporters.”', 'The company moved the TikTok teams responsible for overseeing U.S. user information, security and article moderation into an American subsidiary, U.S. Data Security, that now employs more than 2,000 workers. Nearly all are Americans, a company spokesperson said, except for a few dozen British and Australian workers hired for around-the-clock support.', 'The company also shifted American users’ data to servers run by Oracle, the Texas-based tech giant that the U.S. military entrusts with some of its most highly classified cloud-computing work.', 'Some of its efforts, however, have been stymied by the government’s reluctance to engage, U.S. Data Security officials said at a briefing this month for the Center on Technology Policy, a policy think tank at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that has received funding from foundations and tech companies including Google, Meta and TikTok.', 'According to attendees at the briefing, TikTok said it had submitted to the government a list of nominees for directors, but that federal officials had yet to approve them. That has left U.S. Data Security without an independent board.', 'The administration official declined to offer a response on this point. Without an agreement in place, it’s unclear how any such board nomination would apply.', 'TikTok also pledged to allow the U.S. government to set the rules for hiring, including requiring all new hires to be U.S. citizens or green-card holders, to consent to background checks and to accept that their employment offers could be revoked by government officials as they saw fit.', 'With no agreement in place, however, TikTok has been conducting its own background checks, the officials said in the briefing. A spokesperson said TikTok’s human resources work for U.S. employees still runs through ByteDance but that the company expects to fully transition the work into U.S. Data Security within a matter of weeks.', 'The stalled arrangement also has undermined Oracle’s ability to conduct third-party review. Though Oracle employees are actively reviewing TikTok’s source code for flaws and vulnerabilities, the U.S. Data Security officials said the government’s failure to participate has meant the code reviewers have no clear process for how they would report any red flags they might find.', 'Matt Perault, a former Facebook policy director who leads the UNC center, said those missed connections have weakened the government’s ability to guard against the risks it has long characterized as national threats.', '“For the system to have the level of verification the government seems to want, the government has to play ball,” Perault said. “If you’re serious about trying to address concerns, you would suggest a set of remedies. And essentially what the government has said is there’s no remedy other than a sale.”', 'Some critics of TikTok’s plan label it a “catch me if you can” proposal that would require the government to sniff out risks. In March, the co-sponsors of the House legislation, Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who resigned last month, said in a resolution that Project Texas would have allowed the app’s algorithm and source code to “remain in China under ByteDance’s control” and potentially expose U.S. users to “malicious code, backdoor vulnerabilities, surreptitious surveillance, and other problematic activities.”', 'Others have alluded to the pitfalls of taking over responsibility for a digitally complicated cultural juggernaut. At a congressional hearing in March, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray acknowledged that U.S. officials might find it “extraordinarily difficult to detect” if the Chinese government had forced ByteDance to promote videos that would agitate Americans or boost Chinese Communist Party ideals.', 'The law gave ByteDance 270 days from the day of Biden’s April 24 signing to sell TikTok, with an option for a 90-day extension if Biden determines that “significant progress” has been made toward a sale. In a filing, ByteDance argued the possibility of an extension was not feasible, given that it requires the company to take an action that it is fighting in court.', 'If ByteDance does not divest itself of TikTok’s U.S. assets by the deadline, the government will make it unlawful to “distribute, maintain, or update” the app within the United States.', 'Tech experts expect the order would largely be carried out by private companies: Apple and Google’s app stores would be required to stop pushing out app updates or downloads, and Oracle would be forced to stop hosting the app’s data and infrastructure on its U.S.-based servers.', 'Apple and Google declined to comment, but two people familiar with those companies’ thinking said the companies do not expect to weigh in on the matter.', 'One of the people said federal officials had not shared any evidence with the companies substantiating their national security concerns about TikTok. “Everyone internally thinks it’s the biggest bunch of bulls---,” this person said of the concerns, “but they’ve just decided to stay out of harm’s way.”', 'TikTok, ByteDance and a group of TikTok creators who sued over the law joined with the Justice Department in asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to fast-track the case and offer a ruling by Dec. 6. That would allow time for either side to seek a Supreme Court review of the ruling before the current forced-sale deadline of Jan. 19.', 'Because the law requires all challenges to run through the appeals court as its “exclusive jurisdiction,” the case will operate differently from traditional legal battles, court filings show. Instead of a discovery or fact-finding phase where evidence and witnesses would be presented, usually handled by a district court, the parties will file legal briefs for the court’s judges to review.', 'On Tuesday, a panel of three judges ordered that the companies and the creators must submit their briefs by June 20, and the Justice Department by July 26, a filing shows. Oral arguments are scheduled to begin in September.', 'The Justice Department told the court in a separate filing earlier this month that it is “evaluating” whether it needs to file an evidentiary submission that would contain “classified material to support the [law’s] national security justifications.”', 'While the government has offered some classified briefings for lawmakers, it hasn’t publicly shared any evidence showing the Chinese government has exercised influence over the app. In March, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to declassify information about TikTok so as “to better educate the public on the need for urgent action.” A spokeswoman in Blumenthal’s office said they haven’t received a response. An ODNI spokesperson said they were continuing “engagement with Congress on the issue.”', 'Chander, the Georgetown law professor, said the lack of government substantiation after five years of investigating has made it hard to understand the government’s current urgency over an app millions of Americans use for news and entertainment.', '“It’s hard to square this as an immediate threat if the Biden campaign keeps posting TikToks,” he said.",

        "heading": "Al Ruddy, Oscar-winning producer of ‘The Godfather,’ dies at 94",
        "article": "Albert S. Ruddy, who helped create the sitcom “Hogan’s Heroes” and won Oscars for producing “The Godfather” and “Million Dollar Baby” — two blockbusters, released three decades apart, that exemplified his talent for combining what he called “art and arithmetic” — died May 25 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 94.', 'His publicist, Susan Patricola, announced the death in a statement but did not cite a cause.', 'A smooth-talking raconteur with a colorful arsenal of four-letter words, Mr. Ruddy took a circuitous path to show business, working as a construction site supervisor, computer programmer and part-time shoe salesman before he began writing television scripts in the early 1960s. He went on to demonstrate a talent for bringing in pictures on time and on budget, cutting deals, smoothing over conflicts and navigating studio politics with a finesse that would have impressed Tom Hagen, the imperturbable fixer played by Robert Duvall in the Godfather films.', 'Part peacemaker, part ringmaster, he produced movies that ranged from the intimate and brutal boxing drama “Million Dollar Baby” (2004) — a critical and commercial juggernaut directed by his friend Clint Eastwood, who also starred — to duds like “Matilda” (1978), featuring Elliott Gould and a boxing kangaroo, and “Megaforce” (1982), in which musical theater stalwart Barry Bostwick flies a winged motorcycle into the back of a plane.', 'At the outset of his career, Mr. Ruddy partnered with actor and writer Bernard Fein to develop an audacious idea for a sitcom set at a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. The result, “Hogan’s Heroes,” premiered in 1965 on CBS and starred Bob Crane as U.S. Col. Robert Hogan, who spars with a bumbling Nazi commandant while hatching plans to commandeer German tanks, blow up bridges and steal enemy war plans.', 'The show raised questions of taste and sensitivity but ran for six seasons, helping Mr. Ruddy break into film producing. Hired by Paramount Pictures, he went on to produce and develop the story for “The Longest Yard” (1974), the bone-crunching prison sports movie about a group of inmates playing football against their guards, and reunited with the film’s star, Burt Reynolds, for action comedies including “The Cannonball Run” (1981).', 'Mr. Ruddy remained best known for his work on “The Godfather” (1972), a gangster epic about family, loyalty, crime and power that became one of the most beloved and highest-grossing movies of all time. Based on a hit novel by Mario Puzo, the film proved tumultuous for everyone involved in the production, including Paramount executive Robert Evans, who optioned the source material, and studio vice president Peter Bart, who pushed to hire director Francis Ford Coppola.', 'Mr. Ruddy was credited with championing and protecting Coppola’s vision, including when the director insisted on reworking the script to set it in the 1940s and ’50s, instead of in the present, and shooting the film on location in New York instead of on a studio lot in Hollywood — decisions that helped drive the cost from $2.5 million to more than $6 million.', 'He also backed Coppola’s casting decisions, notably the use of Marlon Brando, a mercurial star who was believed to be past his prime, and Al Pacino, an up-and-coming actor whom Evans dismissed as “a runt.”', '“Al Ruddy was absolutely beautiful to me the whole time on ‘The Godfather’; even when they didn’t want me, he wanted me,” Pacino said in a statement. “He gave me the gift of encouragement when I needed it most.”', 'Mr. Ruddy’s most significant contribution to the film may have been his role in easing tensions with organized crime figures including Joseph Colombo Sr., the founder of the Italian-American Civil Rights League and head of one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia.', 'The league spearheaded opposition to the film, which it deemed anti-Italian, leading Mr. Ruddy to question “whether he would be able to make the movie at all,” according to a 1971 New York Times report detailing fears of union strikes, boycotts and other labor troubles.', 'In the lead-up to the production, Mr. Ruddy also had concerns about his own safety. He received threatening phone calls and was warned by the Los Angeles Police Department that he was being tailed through the city, leading him to swap cars with his assistant in a bid to avoid detection. One night, his assistant found that the windows of Mr. Ruddy’s sports car had been shot out, with a note left on the dashboard to make the message clear: Shut down the production, or else.', 'Mr. Ruddy arranged a meeting with Colombo in New York and pulled out a copy of the script while seeking to demonstrate that the movie was not anti-Italian. Interviewed by journalist Mark Seal for a 2009 account in Vanity Fair, he recalled that Colombo seemed to have trouble making sense of the document: “He puts on his little Ben Franklin glasses, looks at it for about two minutes. ‘What does this mean — FADE IN?’”', 'The two men soon worked out a deal, with Mr. Ruddy agreeing to eliminate the word “Mafia” from the script (by his account, it appeared just once) and promising to make a donation to the Italian-American Civil Rights League. Mobsters and their associates soon began appearing on set, joining the cast and serving as unofficial consultants.', '“When the filming actually began,” journalist and author Nicholas Pileggi wrote in the Times article, “Ruddy found that with Colombo’s men around, instead of being harassed by neighborhood toughs, shaken down by various unions, visited by corrupt cops and generally treated like any other movie company in New York, ‘The Godfather’ troupe was untouchable.”', 'The film won three Academy Awards, including best picture for Mr. Ruddy. He accepted the prize from Eastwood, who joined him on the awards stage one more time, 32 years later, when they were honored with the best picture prize for “Million Dollar Baby,” along with fellow producer Tom Rosenberg.', 'Mr. Ruddy once called that film “the hardest movie I ever got involved in,” given its grim ending, although he also declared that “every day of making ‘The Godfather’ was the worst day in my life.” Interviewed for historian Harlan Lebo’s book “The Godfather Legacy,” he said he declined an option to produce the second “Godfather” film because he was so exhausted by the first.', '“I was lucky to have gotten through the movie — skated through — keeping everybody happy,” he said. “That was probably my greatest contribution. I didn’t get hired because I was some kind of creative genius — that was Francis’s job. I am probably the only person who was stupid enough and street-smart enough to enable us to keep going the way we did.”', 'Albert Stotland Ruddy was born in Montreal on March 28, 1930. His parents separated when he was young, and when he was 7 his mother took him and his two siblings to New York City, where she worked as a fur designer.', 'Mr. Ruddy studied architecture at the University of Southern California, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1956. He turned to film production in 1965 with “Wild Seed,” a low-budget drama about a teenage girl who runs away from her adopted parents and searches for her biological father.', 'He later produced the controversial satire “Coonskin” (1975), which mixed live action and animation in a sendup of Disney’s “Song of the South,” and helped launch TV action shows, serving as an executive producer of the CBS series “Walker, Texas Ranger,” starring Chuck Norris, and “Martial Law,” in which Sammo Hung played a Chinese martial arts expert fighting crime in Los Angeles.', 'While working on “The Godfather,” Mr. Ruddy was married to Françoise Wizenberg Glazer, who became a top aide to the Indian mystic Rajneesh, adopting the name Ma Prem Hasya. Their marriage ended in divorce.', 'Survivors include his wife of 43 years, Wanda McDaniel, an Armani executive; and their two children, John and Alexandra Ruddy.', 'Mr. Ruddy’s last completed film was “Cry Macho” (2021), starring and directed by Eastwood, from a novel by N. Richard Nash that Mr. Ruddy had been trying to produce for decades. (His other long-gestating projects included an adaptation of Ayn Rand’s book “Atlas Shrugged,” which never made it to the screen.) He also served as an executive producer of “The Offer” (2022), a Paramount Plus miniseries about the making of “The Godfather,” in which he was played on-screen by Miles Teller.', 'For all the Coppola film’s difficulties, he still had fond memories of the production and the underworld figures it brought him in contact with. “I’d rather deal with a mob guy shaking hands on a deal,” he told Seal, “than a Hollywood lawyer who, the minute you get the contract signed, is trying to figure out how to screw you.”', 'A previous version of this obituary incorrectly said that Al Ruddy was born in 1934. He was born in 1930. It also incorrectly said that “The Godfather” won five Oscars. It won three. The obituary has been corrected.",

        "article": "Israel said Wednesday it had achieved “tactical control” over the boundary that separates Gaza and Egypt, a significant success for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly described control of the area as an objective for Israel in Gaza.', 'An official with the Israel Defense Forces, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said that while Israel does not have “boots on the ground” throughout the boundary, known as the Philadelphi corridor, its control means Israel can “cut off” Hamas supplies via underground tunnels in the corridor.', '“It means we have the ability to cut off the oxygen line that Hamas has used for replenishing and movement in and around that area,” the official said, adding that about 20 cross-border tunnels had been found in the area.', 'The IDF announcement came amid intensifying international condemnation of Israel’s ongoing offensive in Rafah, just north of the Philadelphi corridor, after a strike at a tent camp on Sunday killed at least 45, and amid no sign of an end to fighting. A senior Israeli official said on Wednesday that the war in Gaza could last the rest of this year, prompting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to say there was an urgent need to plan for the “day after” the war.', 'Israeli military control of the Philadelphi corridor could complicate political relations with Cairo, risking a landmark 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty that has led to a half-century of coexistence.', 'Summarized stories to quickly stay informed', 'How a paperwork glitch is hurting student loan borrowers’ credit scores', 'Babies exposed to peanuts less likely to be allergic years later, study says', 'Lawsuit says American Airlines kicked 8 Black men off plane, citing body odor', 'Most D.C.-area sports fans dislike or hate Commanders’ name, poll finds', 'The corridor is a buffer zone and a no man’s land about nine miles long and several hundred yards wide that stretches from the southernmost tip of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel has not had a troop presence along the border since 2005, when the country withdrew its forces from the Gaza Strip.', 'Egyptian officials did not publicly respond to the IDF announcement. A former Egyptian official familiar with negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue, said that the Israeli military presence in the buffer zone appeared to violate the Camp David Accords of 1978, the U.S.-brokered agreements that led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979.', 'U.S. officials have expressed frustration with Israel’s war efforts in recent weeks. Speaking in Moldova on Wednesday, Blinken told reporters that Israel urgently needs a “clear plan” for after the war in Gaza ends that can ensure the enduring defeat of Hamas.', 'Blinken had been asked about comments made by Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser, who had told Kan public radio Wednesday that he was expecting “another seven months of fighting” to destroy Hamas and other militant groups, adding that 2024 would be “a year of war.”', 'The remark showed little sign of a change in course after the horrified global reaction to Sunday’s strike in Rafah. Scenes of charred bodies and accounts of people burning alive prompted global condemnation of Israel’s strike. White House officials lamented the loss of life but said the attack did not cross President Biden’s “red line.”', 'In Moldova, Blinken called the weekend’s attack “horrific,” adding that it has affected all people on a “basic human level.” He said he could not confirm reports that U.S. weapons were used in the strike.', 'Eyewitnesses contacted by The Washington Post on Wednesday said Israeli tanks had pushed closer into central Rafah, accompanying an intense air operation that has led to what they described as a near-constant thud of airstrikes and other explosions. Responding to questions about those reports, the Israeli military said Wednesday that it “does not share the location of its forces.”', 'The witnesses said tanks were near the Awda roundabout in central Rafah and had taken up positions in western parts of the city, including the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, the site of Sunday’s strikes.', 'Israeli forces expanded a cordon around Rafah on Wednesday, according to Mohammad al-Mughair of the civil defense forces in Gaza. “We expect that the Tal al-Sultan camp will be stormed,” Mughair said. Residents in that neighborhood said Israeli forces were increasing surveillance of the area using unmanned vehicles.', 'Nearly 1 million people have fled Rafah in the past three weeks even though there was “nowhere safe to go,” according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which aids Palestinian refugees. Aid groups also warned that Israel’s offensive in Rafah makes relief efforts nearly impossible, with World Central Kitchen announcing Wednesday that ongoing attacks had forced it to suspend its main kitchen there.', 'Algeria has put forward a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council calling for a halt to Israel’s military offensive in Rafah and an immediate cease-fire. It also calls for the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an increase in humanitarian aid into the enclave. A vote is expected in the coming days. It is unclear whether the United States will use its veto power to vote down the proposal.', 'At least 21 people were killed in a tent encampment near Rafah’s coast on Tuesday by what a spokesman for Gaza’s civil defense said was Israeli artillery fire. The Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday that it “did not strike in the humanitarian area in al-Mawasi,” referring to a zone along Gaza’s coast. Witnesses said the strikes occurred just south of the humanitarian zone.', 'A career State Department official involved in the Biden administration’s debates over Israel’s conduct in Gaza resigned this week, citing disagreements with a recently published U.S. government report that claimed Israel was not impeding humanitarian assistance to Gaza, two officials told The Post. The outgoing official, Stacy Gilbert, served in the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. Gilbert sent an email to staff explaining her view that the State Department was wrong to conclude Israel has not obstructed aid to Gaza, officials who read the letter said.', 'At least 36,171 people have been killed and 81,420 injured in Gaza since the war started, said the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 290 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operations in Gaza.', 'Ellen Francis, Kelly Kasulis Cho, Lior Soroka, Kareem Fahim, Claire Parker and Hajar Harb contributed to this report.', 'The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for six months, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding region.', 'The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel that included the taking of civilian hostages at a music festival. (See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded). Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948.', 'Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.', 'U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.', 'History: The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex, predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.

        "article": "Key takeaways', 'Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.', 'Did our AI help? Share your thoughts.', 'It has been two years since Washington’s NFL franchise unveiled its new name as the Commanders, and most D.C.-area fans still don’t care for it.', 'According to an April Washington Post-Schar School poll, most local sports fans (54 percent) say they either dislike or hate the name. Among just local Commanders fans, the antipathy toward the name is even more stark — 58 percent say they don’t like it.', 'In fact, only 16 percent of Commanders fans think the team should keep the name, while most say they would like the team to change to a different name. Again.', '“I’ve been a fan for a long time, since I was a little kid, and obviously the old name was a little problematic. I saw that,” D.C. resident Andrew Ravenscroft said. “I was in favor of changing it. But it’s just kind of a strange name.”', 'In July 2020, after then-owner Daniel Snyder faced mounting pressure from sponsors and local officials, the team announced it would retire its controversial Redskins name and begin a “thorough” search for a new one. The franchise adopted the name Washington Football Team for 18 months, then unveiled the Commanders name, logo and uniforms during a chilly ceremony at its Landover stadium in February 2022.', 'Almost immediately, the rebrand was panned. According to a citywide Washington Post poll taken that month, 49 percent of District residents reported disliking the name, including 17 percent who said they hated it. A similar 48 percent of D.C. residents dislike the team name this spring, including 15 percent who say they hate it.', '“I’m not surprised,” said George Perry, a former vice president of strategic marketing for the team and now an instructor of management and marketing at Christopher Newport University. “When you’ve been rooting for something for [87] years or whatever the number of years was, you’re pretty attached to it, no matter what everybody else’s feeling is about that brand. The Super Bowls are attached to it, your favorite players are attached to it, you had jerseys, you had shirts. Getting fans to support another name, I think, was going to be a challenge no matter what the name was.”', 'No NFL team has changed its name three times in a decade without changing regions. Doing so is costly, and the league’s bylaws stipulate that a franchise can change its name, logo and uniforms only once every five years. But there are exceptions, including a change in ownership.', 'Perhaps it was no surprise, then, that shortly after Snyder sold the team to an investment group led by Josh Harris last July, calls for the team to scrap its name seemed to intensify.', 'In an open-ended follow-up question in the latest poll, some fans volunteered suggestions, which varied widely. Three percent of Commanders fans offered “Redwolves,” another 2 percent suggested “Warriors,” 2 percent said “Red Tails” and a smaller percentage posed “Red Skin Potatoes.”', 'No, really.', 'During the club’s 18-month search for a name, it eliminated Redwolves and Wolves (and variations of such) because of trademark conflicts. It also ruled out Warriors because of its association with Native American themes.', '“Such an embrace of potentially Native-adjacent iconography and imagery would not represent a clear departure that many communities have so forcefully advocated for us to embrace, and that frankly, we set out to do when we started this process a year ago,” President Jason Wright said in a lengthy 2021 post on the team’s website.', 'Matt Price, a Montgomery County resident who was in favor of the team moving on from the old name — “It was long overdue, and I was very happy to hear it,” he said — believes the current name is “pretentious and pompous.”', '“Who gets excited about that?” he said.', 'Price suggested choosing a generic animal but admitted he would be fine with the team going back to its temporary moniker, the Washington Football Team. And he’s not alone; 17 percent said they would prefer a change back to that name.', 'But a pocket of fans — 16 percent — volunteered a return to the Redskins name in the poll. John Nabinett Jr., a D.C. native who grew up near RFK Stadium, is among them.', '“You still got the Atlanta Braves running around … and the Chiefs in the NFL,” he said, pointing to other pro teams with Native American-themed names. “That seems like a bias when it comes to Washington. Commanders is okay, but it doesn’t reflect the historical value and things like that of a rich program or a team. Commanders is a name, but it’s not an identity. Washington Redskins was an identity.”', 'Washington’s former name was also a source of articleion for decades and became a barrier to the team’s potential return to D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), who has long lobbied for the NFL franchise to move back to the District and play at the federally owned RFK Stadium site, made it clear that the team first had to change its name.', '“People tend to forget that one of the main reasons that they stopped using that name was the pressure they got from their sponsors,” Perry said. “All these other sponsors said, ‘Hey, if you don’t change the name, we’re not going to give you any money.’ That hasn’t necessarily changed. … If it were me, I don’t think it would be my highest priority [to change the name] because you would be starting from scratch again.”', 'Harris’s group did not rule out a future name change when it purchased the team, but it quickly ruled out a return to the former name.', '“That ship has sailed,” Mitch Rales, the top partner in Harris’s ownership group, said in September. “We’re not going to re-litigate the past. We’re about the future. We’re about building the future and not having a divisive culture that we’re engaged in. We’re going to look at everything come the end of the year and think about a lot of different things and do a lot of testing and see what people think. And we’ll learn. The beauty is we have the time to look at all of this stuff intelligently and make fan-based decisions.”', 'A person with knowledge of ownership’s plans reiterated this month that it has no immediate plans in the works to change the name. The group has repeatedly stressed that it has other priorities. This offseason, the Commanders overhauled their front office, coaching staff and roster.

Despite the rigorous training, Dwight was never selected for a NASA mission.', '“Just like every other Black kid, you don’t get something and you convince yourself it wasn’t that important anyway,” Charles Bolden Jr., a former NASA administrator and Dwight’s friend, told The Washington Post.', 'Then, last week, Dwight broke another barrier when, at 90, he became the oldest person to travel into space.

Glover Jr. and Leland D. Melvin — helped change his mind. Dwight had trained for years to go to space — he should finish what he started, he recalled his friends saying.', 'Bolden remembers Dwight telling them how he had lied to himself for all these years about how it didn’t matter. Having lunch with one of the astronauts the day before the launch, Bolden said Dwight admitted it: “There’s this hole in me. I didn’t realize it was there because I had convinced myself it was okay.”', 'Dwight didn’t spend time as a child in Kansas City, Kan., dreaming about becoming an astronaut. In part, because no human had ever been one.', 'Dwight was an Air Force pilot when his commander in chief called upon him.', 'As Dwight describes it: President John F. Kennedy was looking to garner more Black votes when civil rights leader Whitney Young realized the nation’s military academies were graduating talented Black engineers who wouldn’t be accepted into graduate school.', 'The solution was to train a Black astronaut.', 'The White House began searching for a Black pilot with all of the qualifications. It landed on Ed Dwight.', '“I had to be talked into it,” he said. “I wasn’t interested. I had a great military career going.”', 'NASA was three years old at the time, and “nobody knew anything about space,” Dwight said. His mother, Georgia Dwight, talked him into it.', 'Dwight’s acceptance to the space program was headline news in the Black press. Jet magazine interviewed his mother, who recalled what her son said when he learned he would be an astronaut trainee: “Mother, I may be the first man on the moon.”', 'He entered the program as a pilot with 2,000 hours of airtime and an aeronautical engineering degree from Arizona State University.', 'As he expected, Dwight quickly met resistance.', '“There were forces of darkness that didn’t want this to happen because they thought it would spoil the sacred nature of the space-exploration effort,” he said. “It could have hurt NASA quite badly.”', 'Dwight said NASA wanted no part of sending a Black man to space, so the Air Force created the Manned Orbiting Laboratory run by Col.

Yeager also implored Dwight “to give up your spot to one of these deserving White boys.”', 'It didn’t work.', 'In 2019, Yeager denied the racism but agreed that he did not think Dwight should have been in the program.', '“Isn’t it great that Ed Dwight found his true calling and became an accomplished sculptor?” Yeager told the New York Times in an email.

        "heading": "Josh Gibson, excluded by MLB, takes his place in baseball history",
        "article": "Hall of Fame catcher Josh Gibson was one of the most dominant players in baseball history, but he got scant credit from the wider public during his playing days in the 1930s and ’40s, because his exploits took place in the Negro Leagues. Major League Baseball helped amplify his legacy Wednesday, adding Gibson’s stats and those of other Negro Leagues players to its official record. The decision allowed Gibson’s lifetime batting average of .372 to eclipse Ty Cobb’s .367 and surge to the top of the historical ledger — and prompted curiosity about one of the sport’s all-time greats.', 'Gibson was a Bunyanesque figure, known for his prodigious home runs, and sportswriters called him the “Black Babe Ruth” of his era. It’s fitting, then, that MLB’s decision vaulted Gibson over Ruth in two key offensive categories. Gibson now tops the MLB leader board in slugging percentage, at .718, surpassing Ruth’s .690; and in OPS, with his 1.177 mark topping Ruth’s 1.164. Gibson also now holds the single-season batting average mark of .466, which he recorded for the Homestead Grays in 1943.', 'Gibson’s posthumous recognition comes more than 75 years after his playing career ended, a tragic story of exclusion during MLB’s tightly enforced Jim Crow era. Suffering from high blood pressure and the ill effects of excessive drinking, he died of a stroke at the age of 35 in January 1947 — just three months before Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier.', 'The world barely noticed Gibson’s death. The Washington Post published a single newswire paragraph Jan. 21, 1947, headlined: “Negro Homer King, Josh Gibson, Dies.” The New York Times gave it scant more coverage, publishing a three-paragraph wire-service obituary under the headline, “Gibson, Hard Hitter, Dies,” at the bottom of its sports page. The story did not mention that Gibson, like other Black players, had been excluded from playing in Major League Baseball.', 'That Times wire story noted the era’s limitations in compiling Negro Leagues stats. “Because of incomplete records it is not possible to compile Gibson’s lifetime batting average,” the obit noted. “However, he was a power hitter and his smashing home runs won many a game for the Grays.”', 'In recent decades, researchers have filled in those statistical gaps by painstakingly reviewing newspapers, scorebooks and other archives, which helped lead to Wednesday’s announcement.', '“We all know Josh Gibson had a great career in the Negro Leagues,” his great-grandson, Sean Gibson, told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “He is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time, but we always considered Josh Gibson a major leaguer anyway. It’s just now that he’s recognized in the Major League Baseball stats.”', 'Gibson starred for the Pittsburgh Crawfords in the early- and mid-1930s before switching to their rivals, the Homestead Grays, in 1937. The Grays’ original home was in Homestead, Pa., but they began splitting their games between Homestead and Washington before primarily playing in the nation’s capital. Gibson teamed up with another future Hall of Famer, Grays first baseman Buck Leonard, and together they formed a fearsome back-to-back threat. They became known as the “Black Babe Ruth and Black Lou Gehrig.” In his first season for the Grays, Gibson hit .417 with 20 homers and 73 RBI in just 39 games.', '“Josh Gibson was the most feared hitter in the Negro Leagues because he not only hit with great power but also for high average,” Adrian Burgos Jr., a historian of U.S. Latinos, baseball, sports and urban history at the University of Illinois, wrote in an email. He added that Gibson was recruited by baseball leagues in Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Venezuela.', 'Before Gibson joined the Grays, Leonard once recalled, the team employed a unique shift against him, trying to neutralize his Ruthian power. In a 1970 Washington Star story with Negro Leagues historian John Holway, Leonard wrote:', 'The Grays played at Griffith Stadium near the present site of Howard University, which was also the home of the Washington Senators, and the Negro Leagues team was a big draw in the city’s Black community. Gibson had one particularly dominant performance at the ballpark in July 1939, in a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Stars, when he homered three times and hit a triple.', '“Each of his roundtrippers was well up in the stands, but the second, which nearly cleared the park, came with the score tied 7-all in the ninth and gave the Grays the victory,” The Post reported about the first game. The Post called him the team’s “mild-mannered backstop” and wrote that one of his homers “followed the left-field foul line until it went out of sight.”', 'There was one pitcher, however, who always seemed to vex him: legendary Kansas City Monarchs ace Satchel Paige. During a game in 1942, for example, Paige walked two men intentionally to load the bases and face Gibson, and then taunted him, “Three fastballs, Josh,” before fanning him on three pitches. The next year, when the teams faced off in the 1942 Negro World Series, Gibson came to bat with the bases loaded and the Grays trailing 8-4. Once again, Paige struck him out, and the Monarchs swept the four-game series. It was an uncharacteristic performance for Gibson, who managed just one hit — a single — in 13 at-bats.', 'But Gibson was proficient at more than just hitting and boasted a cannon of an arm from behind home plate. None other than former Senators ace Walter Johnson, considered one of the best pitchers ever, raved about him after seeing Gibson play in a 1939 spring training game in Orlando, comparing him favorably to Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, another future Hall of Famer.', '“There is a catcher that any big league club would like to buy for $200,000,” Johnson told Post sports columnist Shirley Povich. “I’ve heard of him before. His name is Gibson. They call him ‘Hoot’ Gibson, and he can do everything. He hits that ball a mile. And he catches so easy he might just as well be in a rocking chair. Throws like a rifle. Bill Dickey isn’t as good a catcher. Too bad this Gibson is a colored fellow.”', 'Burgos called Gibson “a commanding presence at the plate, whether in the catcher’s box or batter’s box. Other Negro Leagues catchers were better known as defensive stalwarts, but no one presented the combination of offense and defense that Gibson did.”', 'The Senators, who leased their ballpark to the Grays, weren’t very good back then, but owner Clark Griffith whiffed on a chance to sign Gibson and Leonard — despite giving some lip service to the idea. Leonard recalled that one day in the early 1940s, the owner asked to meet with them.', 'According to a 1988 Post story by Holway, adapted from his book “Blackball Stars: Negro League Pioneers,” Griffith mentioned the campaign by Black sportswriters to put the two stars on the Senators’ roster. Then he posed this question: “Well, let me tell you something: If we get you boys, we’re going to get the best ones. It’s going to break up your league. Now what do you think of that?”', 'Leonard said they replied that they would be happy to play in the major leagues but would leave it to others to make the case. Gibson and Leonard never heard from Griffith again.', 'Progress toward recognizing Negro Leagues stars such as Gibson has taken decades. Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams, whom some consider the best hitter of all time, deserves credit for giving the effort an early nudge in his 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech.', '“I hope that someday the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way could be added as a symbol of the great Negro players that are not here only because they were not given a chance,” he said.', 'A few years later, that recognition came — but initially with a big asterisk. In 1971, MLB agreed to admit Negro Leagues stars but said they would be honored in a separate section. After a torrent of criticism that this amounted to “separate but equal” treatment, MLB scrapped that plan and Paige was inducted as the first Negro Leagues star.', 'The next year, Gibson and Leonard were inducted, but some of the news coverage treated them as if they were afterthoughts. “In a perfectly appropriate blend of sentiment, humor and brevity, Yogi Berra, Sandy Koufax, Lefty Gomez and five less glamorized figures were inducted into baseball’s Hall of Fame today,” the New York Times reported, lumping the Negro Leagues stars in the “less glamorized” category.', 'This week’s recognition was greeted with far more respect. Gibson, Burgos wrote, “represents the greatness that emerged in the Negro Leagues during the era of MLB’s color line,” which is now reflected in the sport’s record book.",

Investigators linked Terbulatov’s Wikipedia account to the same phone number used to administer the chat group for Ramzan Kadyrov’s official Telegram channel.

Some of these reporters were arrested in occupied Crimea prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, while others were captured in Ukrainian territories that came under occupation after February 2022. In a recent report, Novaya Gazeta Europe profiled more than a dozen Ukrainian journalists who are currently in Russian captivity. Meduza shares some of their stories here.', 'On March 18, 2022, the Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske announced that one of its journalists, Viktoria Roshchyna, had disappeared while reporting in Russian-occupied territory. The newsroom had lost contact with Roshchyna on March 12. Russian FSB agents had arrested her when she tried to leave Berdyansk for Mariupol. Roshchyna spent ten days in Russian custody and was then released after being forced to record a video claiming that she had no complaints about her detention and that Russian forces had “saved her life.”', 'In early August 2023, Roschyna disappeared for a second time while reporting from occupied territory in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region. According to the Ukrainian news site Graty, she was reporting on Russia’s sham elections in the region, as well as the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and conditions at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The journalist’s family received no news about her whereabouts for nine months, despite their attempts to contact Russian authorities, including Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkovka. Then, earlier this week, Roschyna’s father, Volodymyr Roschyn, received a letter from the Russian Defense Ministry confirming that she had been arrested and “is located on the territory of the Russian Federation.” According to Graty, the letter didn’t provide any further details about Roschyna’s whereabouts or the reason for her detention.', 'Journalist Dmytro Khyliuk reported for the outlet UNIAN in Kyiv. On March 1, 2022, he wrote on social media that Russian forces had reached Kozarovychi, the village in the Kyiv region where he and his family were staying.

        "article": "Like our earlier reports on the combat situation in Ukraine, this article takes stock of the recent developments on the battlefield based on open-source information. Meduza has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the very start, and our detailed military analyses are part of our commitment to objective reporting on a war we firmly oppose.', 'Russia’s new offensive in the border areas of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region has stalled after the Ukrainian command deployed substantial reserves to the area. This “rescue team” appears to have been assembled by drawing individual battalions from all fronts, with groups from a dozen different brigades now engaged in the fighting. Predictably, redeploying troops in this manner has weakened defenses in other areas. In recent days, the Russian army has been launching attacks in a dozen different sectors — from Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region to the Kupyansk front east of Kharkiv — making small but consistent gains everywhere. Moreover, the situation near Kharkiv remains dangerous for the Ukrainian army, as Russia clearly hasn’t committed all its available forces to the battle here.', 'Ukrainian troops managed to stop Russian infantrymen, who were advancing north and northeast of the city of Kharkiv with almost no armored support, north of Lyptsi (a satellite town about 18.5 miles from Kharkiv) and in the city of Vovchansk. In both areas, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) are counterattacking on the flanks of Russian breakthroughs, narrowing the front of the Russian attack and preventing Russian troops from advancing further.', 'In Vovchansk, Russian infantrymen reached the Vovcha River, which roughly bisects the city. The Russian army has so far been unable to secure a bridgehead on the far side of the river. Most likely, Russian forces will continue pushing AFU units back across the river and then attempt to cross it. Since all bridges over the Vovcha have been destroyed, even if Russian troops do succeed in establishing a bridgehead on the other side, it will be difficult to supply it. The Russian command probably plans to cross the river not within the city, but to the west and/or east of it.', 'Meduza has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the very start, and we are committed to reporting objectively on a war we firmly oppose. Join Meduza in its mission to challenge the Kremlin’s censorship with the truth.Donate today.', 'The attack on the northern outskirts of Kharkiv still appears to be a diversionary strike mainly focused on Vovchansk. The Russian army was able to reach the first target of its diversionary blow: the outskirts of Lyptsi. However, successful AFU counterattacks have slowed the Russian advance here, and the Ukrainian army was even able to recapture part of the previously lost village of Hlyboke on the eastern flank.', 'It’s probable that the Russian command will also deploy reserves to the area. So far, almost no armored vehicles have been used in the attack, and there are only individual battalions from the various brigades and regiments of the operational group “Sever” on the battlefield. Meanwhile, armored vehicles with “Sever” tactical markings have been spotted on railway platforms deep within Russia. Moreover, members of Russia’s 47th Tank Division — which isn’t part of the Leningrad Military District from which “Sever” draws its forces — have been spotted in battles near Vovchansk. Most of the 47th Tank Division, however, is still deployed in the Svatove sector.', 'It’s still unclear how the offensive near Kharkiv will impact other fronts or what troops the Ukrainian command can assemble to reinforce its defenses now that they’ve had to pull troops from those areas. However, the AFU was able to quickly establish a relatively strong defense near Kharkiv while preventing an immediate collapse of the front in other areas.', 'It appears that the Russian command might have more effectively utilized the significant reserves from the Leningrad Military District elsewhere, and the decision to open a new front was probably politically driven: Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded the creation of a “buffer zone” of occupied territory along the border, and the command is merely trying to derive military benefit from this order.', 'Russian forces have resumed their offensive at the juncture of Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions, between Kupyansk (controlled by Ukraine) and Svatove (currently under Russian control).', 'The front line in this area was largely established by the end of 2022. Since then, Russian forces have made several attempts to launch a major offensive in the region and push the AFU across the Oskil River, but they haven’t achieved anything beyond minor gains.', 'The resumed offensive began with another series of localized gains: Russian troops have advanced in at least five different directions and have captured the villages of Berestove and Ivanivka.', 'The main difference now is the AFU’s difficult situation with reserves. It will be hard for the Ukrainian command to reinforce this front, especially since it was previously weakened when troops from here were sent to defend Avdiivka and Vovchansk.', 'Following a weeks-long hiatus, the Russian army has resumed its offensive near the village of Ocheretyne, which it captured in April. Russian troops are advancing both northward (reaching the outskirts of the village of Novooleksandrivka) and westward (with battles beginning for the villages of Sokil and Novopokrovske). It’s likely this will soon escalate into a large-scale offensive. Russia’s primary objective here is to reach the road between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka — a critical supply line for the AFU.', 'The Russian Armed Forces are relentlessly trying to undo all the limited achievements of Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive. Over the past week, they’ve taken the destroyed village of Robotyne (or most of it) in the Zaporizhzhia region and the ruins of Klishchiivka to the south of Bakhmut. The Russian command’s determination to recapture territories near Bakhmut that were liberated last summer could be due to their strategic importance for the offensive on Chasiv Yar. An assault on the eastern outskirts of Chasiv Yar in May was largely unsuccessful; the Russian army clearly needs to bring in more troops from the south, particularly from the direction of Klishchiivka.', 'In the case of Robotyne, however, the Russian command’s strategy is unclear. It’s possible that they plan to transfer troops currently stationed in defense positions along the eastern bank of the Dnipro River and launch a major offensive on the cities of Orikhiv and Hulyaipole.', 'The Russian Armed Forces are also trying to recapture villages in the Sukhi Yaly River valley, south of the village of Velyka Novosilka, on the border of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Ukrainian forces liberated these settlements in the summer of 2023. Russian troops have already partially occupied Staromaiorske and Urozhaine — villages Ukraine recaptured last summer.",

Back then, they were recruited not into the army but into the Wagner Group mercenary organizationand some volunteer units.

Though the war in the Donbas had been going on since 2014, he says he faced little discrimination or harassment for his nationality during his initial years at the school.', '“[Students from Ukraine] were generally treated fine [at that point],” he tells Meduza. “Although when I turned in my enrollment documents, they said, ‘Are you sure you’re a foreign student?

In response, the officers took his phone, showed him screenshots of his anti-war posts, and demanded he write a confession statement. He recounts:', 'I wrote that I’d made those posts calling for people to donate to a Ukraine relief fund two years ago. They also searched through my phone and all of my financial transactions, but they didn’t find anything.', 'The following morning, Hulko was brought to a district court, where he was charged with “resisting the authorities” during his arrest. The judge sentenced him to spend the next 10 days in jail.', 'On the day of Hulko’s release, he was detained by police as soon as he exited the detention facility. Because it was the weekend, the officers brought him to a holding cell at their station, where he spent the next two nights.

He tells Meduza:', 'The following morning, April 26, I was taken to the prosecutor’s office and served an order to leave the country within three days. After that, though, I was taken to the Tver District Court and sentenced to 12 [more] days for an Instagram story calling for a strike on Moscow, which I published after a [Russian] strike in Odesa that killed a family with a three-month-old baby. After serving that term, I was brought to the deportation center.', 'Meduza has learned from sources that after Hulko’s initial arrest, some of his friends reached out for help to Maria Vorontsova, the deputy dean of his university department and the daughter of Vladimir Putin. When asked whether the authorities’ relative leniency may have been a result of Vorontsova’s interference, Hulko says the following:', 'Frank speaking, I think that there simply wasn’t enough of an evidentiary basis for [the authorities] to charge me with a felony. All they had were screenshots; they didn’t have any concrete actions on my part. I’m a citizen of a different country, so it’s unlikely they would charge me with treason. But it would be silly for me to deny that I got very lucky in this case. I’m doing fine now and I’m in a safe place.', 'While he feels fortunate to have escaped further prosecution in Russia, Hulko regrets not being able to get his degree. “I was the best in my year by far— I spent a lot of time in hospitals and even did surgeries myself. It’s hard to lose all of that,” he says.', 'At the same time, he tells Meduza, living in the country waging an aggressive war against his own took a psychological toll. “Every day, it took effort to mentally compartmentalize my studies and what was happening in my homeland,” he says. “I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s important to me to become a doctor, and the education at MSU really is wonderful.”', 'Hulko says his professors had a variety of views on the war but that a majority of them are “decent people and understand everything”:', 'Overall, I don’t believe that all Russians are bad. When I found myself in trouble, an unbelievable number of people helped me: my friends, human rights advocates, and complete strangers.', 'Interview by Svetlana Reiter.

The audience for De Niro’s ravings was not America It wasn’t even undecided voters in the swing states.It was the 12 fact-finders ensconced a few dozen yards away, inside the courthouse.', 'De Niro focused heavily on his status as a quintessential New Yorker. \"This is my neighborhood,\" he proclaimed. \"I grew up down here…. I love this city.\" But (ostensibly) unlike Trump: \"I don’t want to destroy it.\"', 'Why would a swing voter in Michigan or Pennsylvania care a lick about what Trump is alleged to be doing to De Niro’s old neighborhood?', 'They don’t.But 12 jurors who we know live in Manhattan certainly might. And so De Niro’s simple message was: \"Convict Trump.Save New York.\" He was playing to New Yorkers’ well-documented tendency to see the city as the center of the earth, and everywhere else as camping out.', 'This is also why De Niro distastefully invoked 9/11 and equated Trump with the al Qaeda terrorists who took down the World Trade Center.He knows that to many New Yorkers, 9/11 is an event that still resonates.', 'De Niro also checked his notes and wedged in a reference to crime, claiming that, \"it’s no surprise that the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are falling under Biden.\"The actor must know that the issue of crime is much on the minds of New Yorkers these days, as they see their city descending into 1970s-like disorder.', 'Now, just for reference: New York City’s violent crime numbers decidedly did NOT \"peak\" under Trump; in fact, at the end of Biden’s first year in office (2021), New York’s citywide violent crime rate was up a full 11.3%.', 'Bringing that closer to home for Manhattanites, the latest NYPD violent crime numbers for our borough show us up 5.6% so far this year, and for the period roughly covering the current trial, we’re up roughly 15%. ', 'De Niro is either disingenuous or oblivious.Does he not realize that, while these numbers are reality, the man charged with addressing those numbers, Alvin Bragg, is instead burning resources on a quixotic fever-dream case against Trump?', 'That Team Biden would deploy De Niro at that location, at this time, speaks of a certain desperation; Biden’s numbers are tanking, and if the jury hangs or Trump is acquitted, Trump’s lead will likely spike.So Biden and his proxies need this conviction in order to hang the \"f\" word — felon — on Trump going forward. If he’s convicted, there won’t be a reference to Donald Trump on CNN or MSNBC or in The New York Times that won’t be preceded by the term, \"convicted felon.\"', 'But that wider focus was really not the immediate purpose of the De Niro spectacle.Because as this case concludes and its indecipherable contours become apparent, the slam-dunk conviction the Bidens were likely counting on appears in doubt (even many liberal commentators are mystified by the case’s theory).', 'Now, I’m aware that, theoretically, the jurors are supposed to avoid all media and other commentary on the case, despite there being no actual sequestration order.Allow me to tell you that nobody — not even Judge Juan Merchan — believes that.If he did: why would we need an ongoing Trump gag order? ', 'No — Team Biden is banking on the message being delivered.', 'For the rest of the country, that received message will be simple — and it will echo the message of the E. Jean Carroll case and Letitia James’ victimless loan fraud case: Don’t come to New York. If you are not willing to toe the progressive line, don’t visit here, don’t start a business here, and for God’s sake, don’t even think of running for office here.(You might also reconsider attending college here.)', 'Is it any wonder New York State continues to lead the nation in population loss?', 'But while that may be the national takeaway, the real message outside the courthouse Tuesday was directed to 12 of De Niro’s fellow Manhattanites.As the actor put it: \"Donald Trump doesn’t belong in my city.\"', 'In other words: \"Convict.\"', 'No matter what.",

Near the end of his remarks, Todd Blanche included a conspicuous reference to the jury about sending Trump to prison.', 'It’s common knowledge in legal circles that such things are not allowed, which the judge soon noted in rebuking Blanche. He called Blanche’s inclusion of it “outrageous” and noted that a lawyer of his experience must have known better — the apparent suggestion being that Blanche deliberately sought to inappropriately influence the jury.', 'Making Blanche’s apparent gambit even more suspect: the fact that he had been explicitly instructed by the judge not to do such a thing.', 'To recap, Blanche, in the final minutes of his closing argument, painted former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen as an inveterate liar and told the jury, “You cannot send somebody to prison, you cannot convict somebody-”', 'Before he could finish his thought, prosecutors objected, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan sustained the objection.', 'After the jury exited came the rebuke.', '“I think that saying that was outrageous, Mr. Blanche — please have a seat,” Merchan said. “For someone who has been a prosecutor as long as you have, and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It’s simply not allowed. Period. It’s hard for me to imagine how that was accidental in any way.”', 'When the jury returned, Merchan instructed it to completely disregard Blanche’s “improper” comment and to not consider potential sentences in any way. He noted that a prison sentence wasn’t a given if Trump were convicted.', 'But it wasn’t just Blanche’s experience that should have counseled him against such a statement — it was also Merchan’s own instructions. In fact, Merchan explicitly forbade such arguments in an order two months ago.', 'Prosecutors in a February motion had sought a number of limitations.', 'Merchan granted some of the motions March 18. He wrote that the “Defendant is precluded from,” among other things, “making arguments and introducing evidence regarding any potential punishment or other consequences to the Defendant as a result of these proceedings.”', 'Jurors in the vast majority of legal proceedings in the United States are barred from considering potential punishments, with notable exceptions in state courts in Louisiana and North Carolina.', '“Any criminal attorney knows that you are not supposed to bring up the sentence,” said Jeffrey Bellin, a professor at the William & Mary Law School who has studied the subject. He noted that it’s common knowledge in part because there are strong disagreements about it.', 'Wayne State University Law School professor William Ortman added that “the prohibition on talking about potential punishment isn’t some esoteric bit of specialized knowledge.”', 'The reason lawyers are generally not allowed to cite potential prison time is that it’s irrelevant to their task. In most cases, judges get to decide sentences, not juries. One fear is that a jury might decline to convict someone if they worry that the punishment will be too severe. Another is that jurors might fear for their well-being if a criminal gets insufficient prison time.', 'The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that potential punishments should not be considered by juries. In 1994’s Shannon v. United States, a criminal defendant sought to have the jury instructed that finding him not guilty only by reason of insanity would result in his involuntary commitment to a mental institution.', '“The principle that juries are not to consider the consequences of their verdicts is a reflection of the basic division of labor in our legal system between judge and jury,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the 7-2 decision.', '“Information regarding the consequences of a verdict is therefore irrelevant to the jury’s task,” Thomas added in the decision. “Moreover, providing jurors sentencing information invites them to ponder matters that are not within their province, distracts them from their fact-finding responsibilities, and creates a strong possibility of confusion.”', 'In the case of Trump, it would seem logical that jurors might fear a punishment that is too severe, given the unprecedented stature of the defendant. It’s one thing to convict Trump of the mundane-sounding charge of falsifying business records; it would be another to pave the way for a former president of the United States to spend months or years in prison.', '“I think the only possible defense for counsel in this case would be that the reference to prison was meant colloquially — as a stand-in for the seriousness of a criminal conviction — not to foreshadow the sentence Trump would receive,” Bellin said. “But judges typically won’t buy that since there is a clear tactical advantage to raising the prospect of a harsh sentence to make the jury hesitate before convicting.”', 'Ortman said that it was particularly “misleading” for Blanche to broach prison time without noting that such a sentence isn’t required.', 'Trump has been unsubtle about his efforts to make life hell for anyone who would hold him accountable in a court of law. He’s been sanctioned for gesturing at the idea that the jury is biased against him, in violation of his gag order. (The jurors are anonymous, but we’ve already seen how keeping them anonymous has proved difficult.) Merchan has even suggested that Trump’s conduct might intimidate the jury.', 'In that way, you could understand how Blanche’s brief allusion to prison could land with some force — and how Merchan might understand it as an intentional act meant to undermine his court.', 'The jury in Donald Trump’s hush money trial has begun deliberating.

        "article": "As New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan was providing jurors in Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial with instructions aimed at guiding their deliberations, his words — the last jurors will hear before the case is entirely in their hands — were shared with the world by journalists sitting in the courtroom. And one particular instruction quickly became the latest iteration of the pro-Trump right’s effort to cast the entire trial as inherently biased against the former president.', '“Judge Merchan just told the jury that they do not need unanimity to convict,” Fox News’s John Roberts wrote on social media.” “4 could agree on one crime, 4 on a different one, and the other 4 on another. He said he would treat 4-4-4 as a unanimous verdict.”', 'As people immediately pointed out, this is false. The 34 felony charges Trump faces allege that he falsified business records (or caused them to be falsified) to cover up another crime; specifically, conspiracy to influence an election by unlawful means. Merchan’s point wasn’t that unanimity wasn’t needed to convict Trump; it is. His point was that jurors didn’t need to agree on the unlawful means used in that conspiracy to determine that Trump attempted to cover up the conspiracy. Four of them could think the unlawful means was falsifying other documents or four might think it was violating federal election law. It didn’t matter.', 'Roberts’s framing was quickly picked up by right-wing commentators. There was outrage: How could this judge — this judge already pilloried by Trump’s allies — set so low a bar for sending Trump to prison? He didn’t, but the right was ready to believe that he somehow had, because for months so much of what they have heard about the case is that it and the judge overseeing it are illegitimate.', 'Donald Trump has deployed this tactic in response to investigations into his actions for years. When news reports about Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election first emerged, Trump quickly disparaged the reports as false and the intelligence community officials who were sources for the story as biased against him. Every accusation, however robustly founded, became a “hoax” that was simply evidence of how much the people in power were out to get him — even when he was the most powerful person in the free world.', 'It’s been a pattern of inoculation against efforts to hold him accountable that has been unceasing and obviously successful. When CBS News recently asked Americans how they viewed Trump’s criminal trial, three-quarters of Republicans and Democrats each said they had heard at least some news about the trial. But three-quarters of Republicans also said that Trump was not guilty of a crime — and most said they didn’t believe that the jury would determine that he was. Among Democrats, views were reversed.', 'How are partisan views so different? Because the trial has been depicted through a partisan lens, particularly by Trump and his allies. The former president has been unrelenting in disparaging the judge and the process as biased. When Merchan imposed limits on his ability to bad-mouth witnesses or others associated with the trial, Trump took to waving sheaves of paper at reporters suggesting the array of legal experts (almost uniformly ones on the right) who agreed that the whole case was improperly brought and/or an example of deep-seated bias against him. On his Truth Social account, such stories or posts from allies constantly litter his feed. If you receive any communication from Trump at all, you have, in the past month, been subjected to disparagements of what’s happening in Manhattan.', 'Over the course of the trial, Fox News has spent less time mentioning it or Merchan than have its main competitors. Fox News has, however, more often shown hosts or commentators refer to “weaponization” or “lawfare” — terms Trump uses often to suggest that the trial is political in nature.', 'If you are a Republican who tracks Trump’s comments or watches Fox News, you may have indeed heard a lot about the trial. And what you are likely to have heard is that the trial is invalid and contrived, an effort to keep Trump off the campaign trail — over the short term while he was in court or over the long term, should he have to serve a sentence.', 'This effort to inoculate his base against a negative outcome is very familiar. Four years ago, Trump was engaged in a similar effort, pushing false claims about the risks of voter fraud as the 2020 presidential election approached. His goal then was similar to his goal now: Make his base reject an unfavorable outcome by presenting it beforehand as illegitimate.', 'This time, though, the inoculation effort not only serves to delegitimize the trial but to bolster his political position. Since the first criminal charges were filed, it has been clear that Trump sees his legal travails as intertwined with his political efforts. That is partly because being reelected as president will allow him to potentially submarine the federal charges he faces. It is also, in part, because Trump’s 2024 campaign is centered on the idea that he is under attack and needs his supporters to have his back. The trials serve that purpose nicely.', 'It is not clear how the jury will assess the evidence in the Manhattan trial. The case is not open-and-shut, by any stretch. But if the jurors assess the evidence and the letter of the law and find that Trump committed the crimes with which he is charged, there is little reason to think that the result will be accepted by Trump’s supporters on Fox News or anywhere else in the country.', 'If so many refuse to acknowledge that he lost the election after consuming the rhetoric of Trump and his allies, why would they now acknowledge the validity of a trial they have been told is invalid?', 'The jury in Donald Trump’s hush money trial has begun deliberating. Here’s what happens next and what Trump could face if he’s convicted.', 'Key witnesses: Several key witnesses, including Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, have taken the stand.

Her parents have been espousing the same kinds of views for years now. I’ve privately — and publicly via social media — tried to engage respectfully but firmly with them over the years and share my perspective on why LGBTQ rights matter. I did so not with the illusion of changing their minds but in the spirit of knowing I’ve given them accurate information with which they can do what they want.', 'They’ve cut off contact with several family members who are gay at this point.

I live abroad, and I’m not in touch with my niece or my sister often. That probably makes it even less my place to say anything, but I feel wrong not saying or doing anything at all.', 'Is it an aunt or uncle’s place to try to look out for the moral compass of their nieces and nephews?', '— Stuck Aunt', 'Stuck Aunt: Since you’ve already engaged both privately and publicly, any further engagement on the issue sounds likely to drive your sister to cut you off, like she has others. You now have the opportunity to show your support for LGBTQ rights on your own page, along with your clearheaded ability to advocate your position while being respectful to others online. It is not always an easy position to maintain, but it sounds as if your niece needs a better example of how to engage in adult conversations. She might find herself questioning her family’s opinions as she gets older, and, if you’ve kept the door open, she’ll be more likely to turn to you when she starts to question her beliefs.', 'I espoused some pretty ignorant beliefs about being gay when I was younger — before I eventually came out as a lesbian in a conservative area.

Share what you want about your own life. Consider bringing up how your mutual relatives might feel about the particular statements made and about being cut out of her life and vice versa. Anything you can do to make this connection personal rather than political or abstract is likelier to leave you feeling you’ve done what you can — and it might have some impact.', '— Pragmatic Idealist', 'Stuck Aunt: Your niece is young and parroting her parents’ beliefs — they are the biggest influences in her life.

He has adamantly denied this, saying that he only went to her house as a bet from his friend — the one who was using his profile on the dating app.', 'I’m trying to move forward from this situation, but I don’t know if I believe my boyfriend.

Helping these children grow up together will require patience and a willingness to allow lots of feelings to coexist.', 'It isn’t just your nephew who is in a tough space developmentally; at 3 years old, your son is in his own developmental stage that makes sharing difficult. Your child is most likely also not sharing or, if he is, he isn’t enjoying it. During toddler years, a child is learning that they are a real person, and before they can consider other people’s feelings, they must wrestle with their own.', 'It is easy in our culture to “other” the child with obvious differences (in this case, autism), but this absolves us of our own need for growth. I am weary of the dancing around we do to keep up the appearance of the ever-elusive “normal.” Let’s just work with what is front of us, with both children. Because of the ages of the children in your letter, I think you know that they are not old enough to “navigate their relationship on their own.” There isn’t one right thing to say or do; your son’s and Max’s growth will ebb and flow over the years, but if you stay steady, both children will be better for having each other.', 'As for what you should do, I turned to Yolanda Williams — a parenting coach who specializes in positive discipline, a racial justice educator, and a mother to a child on the autism spectrum — for more insight. She suggests supervising the kids’ playdates so you can remind your son that it’s okay if Max doesn’t feel like sharing or explain to him that it’s okay if Max isn’t very responsive.', 'Williams also says it’s okay to encourage Max to share, but if he’s resistant, lead your son to pick another toy. “Max is not capable of navigating the relationship as neurotypical kids are. He will naturally be ‘othered’ because he is different and small kids notice differences, which is why adults have to intervene and advocate for disabled children by accommodating their needs and teaching their children to do the same,” Williams says. “There is nothing wrong with being disabled or different, but when you don’t speak about the disability or difference, children will see them in a negative light.”', 'She offers this script when talking to your son about Max’s disability: “Max is autistic, which means his brain works differently than yours does. He needs a little bit more space when playing, and it may be hard for him to share. But you can play alongside him. That’s what Max needs to feel safe and comfortable.”', 'As you’re helping your son develop more patience with and compassion for Max, I suggest you dive into emotion coaching. Emotion coaching is where parents help children slow down, tune into their emotions, name them and (possibly) find solutions. Crucially, parents need to navigate this process first, a step that many miss but is needed to co-regulate with children. The more emotions a child can name, the more likely they are to communicate clearly to adults. It may look and sound like placing a gentle hand on the shoulder and saying: “I see frustration about playing with the firetruck. It is tiring to share. I get it.” Let the child process this before you jump into fixing anything. This is where parents usually rush things, but it benefits the children to give emotions space because it communicates that everyone can handle big emotions. When children feel that their parents understand them, they are more likely to relax, cooperate and calm more easily.', 'Finally, pick up children’s books where lots of different children are represented and while reading them, say, “That’s like Max, right?

Alito Jr. against each other — with Justice Thomas writing the majority opinion and Justice Alito writing the dissent.', 'Both are viewed as the high court’s most conservative justices who are originalists, and in the past, they’ve typically been on the same side in most cases.', 'In the 2021 term, for example, the two were in agreement 73% of the time, according to SCOTUSBlog, which appears to have stopped tracking justices’ agreement data in recent years.', '“I was surprised by the split between Thomas and Alito here. I think this may have to do with backroom conversations,” said Adam Feldman, Supreme Court scholar and creator of the EmpiricalSCOTUS blog.', 'Mr. Feldman said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could have seen that Justice Thomas would allow the CFPB to stand and had him author the opinion to give him more freedom to direct the case’s ultimate outcome.', 'The chief justice, when in the majority, assigns who writes the majority decision.', 'SEE ALSO: Supreme Court rules CFPB funding structure is lawful, jarring attempt to undo Wall Street cop', '“I’m not shocked by [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch’s position in dissent as the dissent seems more grounded in ostensible originalism. I wasn’t surprised that Alito wanted to overhaul the CFPB because of its unique structure that in some sense seeps power from Congress. Thomas is the quirky vote and so I think the discretion he was given in opinion authorship was what motivated him to side with the majority,” Mr. Feldman said.', 'The reaction comes after the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the funding structure for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is lawful, delivering a blow to conservatives who have sought for years to do away with the agency.', 'Congress, when it created the CFPB, allowed the agency to go straight to the Federal Reserve for funding rather than going through annual appropriations from Congress, as most other agencies do.', 'Critics argued that the structure ran afoul of the Constitution. But in a 7-2 decision on Thursday, the high court said it was permissible.', '“Under the Appropriations Clause, an appropriation is simply a law that authorizes expenditures from a specified source of public money for designated purposes. The statute that provides the Bureau’s funding meets these requirements. We therefore conclude that the Bureau’s funding mechanism does not violate the Appropriations Clause,” wrote Justice Thomas for the majority.', 'Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch disagreed with the majority, noting in a dissent that the CFPB could “bankroll” its own agenda without oversight from Congress.', '“In short, there is apparently nothing wrong with a law that empowers the Executive to draw as much money as it wants from any identified source for any permissible purpose until the end of time. That is not what the Appropriations Clause was understood to mean when it was adopted,” the dissent read.', 'Ilya Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute, said he thought the outcome of the case was disappointing but he was not surprised by a split between Justices Thomas and Alito.', '“All of the Republican-appointed justices are independent thinkers and disagree among themselves plenty,” he said. “Progressive criticism that Thomas, Alito, and others bend their interpretive methods to achieve personal policy goals is just projection.”', '• Alex Swoyer can be reached at aswoyer@washingtontimes.com.', 'Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.

Board of Education decision, which outlawed segregation in public schools.', 'He spoke Friday at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, where he framed this year’s election as a civil rights issue.', 'In his remarks, Mr. Biden introduced himself as a “lifelong member of the NAACP” and told the audience that former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, poses a threat to Black people’s rights.', '“Today the resistance comes in other insidious forms. An extreme movement led by my predecessor and his MAGA Republican allies, backed by an extreme Supreme Court, gutted affirmative action in college admissions. My predecessor and his extreme MAGA friends are now going after diversity, equity and inclusion all across America,” Mr. Biden said.', '“They want a country for some, not for all,” he said, accusing Republicans of taking away “fundamental freedoms.”', 'On Sunday, Mr. Biden will deliver the commencement address at Atlanta’s historically Black Morehouse College, which counts civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. among its alumni.', 'The Biden campaign views the Morehouse speech as the cornerstone of these events because his aim will be to connect with the next generation of Black leaders, a demographic with the deepest decline in support.', 'The event is already shaky. Student protesters have called on the school to rescind Mr. Biden‘s invitation over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. The White House this week dispatched aides to the college to meet with student and faculty leaders to quell potential demonstrations.', '“This is a global catastrophe in Gaza, and Joe Biden coming to pander for our votes is political blackface.” Anwar Karim, a Morehouse sophomore, told The Associated Press.', 'After the Morehouse commencement, Mr. Biden will fly to Detroit, where he’ll speak at an NAACP chapter dinner.', 'Also this week, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with leaders of historically Black sororities and fraternities.', 'In 2020, Mr. Biden enjoyed widespread support from African Americans, capturing 92% of their vote. Recent polls, however, show many Black voters flocking to Mr. Trump.', 'A New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states released this week found Mr. Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a head-to-head fight with Mr. Biden. If that holds, it would amount to the highest African American vote for a Republican since Richard Nixon’s 30% in 1960.', 'Although the string of events targeting Black voters is a tacit admission that the president is struggling, NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson dismissed claims of an erosion of support. Speaking with reporters at the White House on Thursday, he predicted Black voters will show up for the president in November.', '“Polls have proven themselves to be untruthful the last four election cycles,” he said. “What I do believe is, we are at a crisis of our democracy. We must decide whether we’re going to have a functioning democracy that’s representing all of the citizens, or something less than that.”', 'Kevin McGary, a civil rights activist and co-founder of Every Black Life Matters, said Mr. Biden is struggling with Black voters because he has taken them for granted.', 'As Mr. McGary sees it, the carefully scripted events won’t resonate with Black voters as much as reducing crime and inflation.', '“The reality is Black communities are faced with inflation every single day — energy inflation, food inflation — and crime that is off the charts every day in major cities,” he said. “Now you see [Mr. Biden] coming into our community because it’s an election year when we’ve been completely taken for granted. It’s condescending, and we are fed up with that.”', 'Democratic strategist David Dix said pollsters and media are too focused on singling out Black voters. He said Mr. Biden‘s erosion of support in the Black community reflects the president’s overall poor polling numbers.', '“He’s struggling with a lot of demographics. It’s not an exclusive failing among African American voters,” Mr. Dix said, citing the economy as a key reason for Mr. Biden‘s struggles.', 'Mr. Dix said the president’s latest push should help him with Black voters because it shows an “effort to make and maintain a connection” with the African American community.', 'But Mr. Dix said the Biden campaign still must do more, including having more diverse voices within his campaign. The Biden campaign has yet to hire a director of African American voting.', 'Earlier this month, the Biden campaign announced it would spend $14 million on ads in exclusively minority-focused media.', 'Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Biden has done at least 11 interviews with Black media personalities.', 'He has used these interviews to highlight his record and lay out the case for why Black voters’ lives would be worse under a Trump presidency.', 'In a radio interview this week with an Atlanta radio station, Mr. Biden called on Black voters to “remember who Trump is.”', '“He falsely accused the Central Park Five. He’s the founder of birtherism, he tried to repeal Obamacare the first time — now he’s promised to do more damage,” he said.', 'Mr. McGary said the president’s own record on race is problematic. While in the Senate, Mr. Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill, which increased Black imprisonment.', '“That bill led to mass incarceration, and there hasn’t been any acknowledgment that it was a failure,” Mr. McGary said.', 'While running for reelection, Mr. Biden has touted his accomplishments that have benefited Black Americans, including appointing the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court. He has also pointed to increases in Black homeownership under his watch as well as efforts to support Black-owned small businesses and historically Black colleges and universities.', '• Jeff Mordock can be reached at jmordock@washingtontimes.com.', 'Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.

        "article": "NEW YORK — Dabney Coleman, the mustachioed character actor who specialized in smarmy villains like the chauvinist boss in “9 to 5” and the nasty TV director in “Tootsie,” has died. He was 92.', 'Coleman died Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, his daughter, Quincy Coleman, said in a statement to The Associated Press. She said he “took his last earthly breath peacefully and exquisitely.”', '“The great Dabney Coleman literally created, or defined, really - in a uniquely singular way - an archetype as a character actor. He was so good at what he did it’s hard to imagine movies and television of the last 40 years without him,” Ben Stiller wrote on X.', 'For two decades Coleman labored in movies and TV shows as a talented but largely unnoticed performer. That changed abruptly in 1976 when he was cast as the incorrigibly corrupt mayor of the hamlet of Fernwood in “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,” a satirical soap opera that was so over the top no network would touch it.', 'Producer Norman Lear finally managed to syndicate the show, which starred Louise Lasser in the heading role. It quickly became a cult favorite. Coleman‘s character, Mayor Merle Jeeter, was especially popular and his masterful, comic deadpan delivery did not go overlooked by film and network executives.', 'A six-footer with an ample black mustache, Coleman went on to make his mark in numerous popular films, including as a stressed out computer scientist in “War Games,” Tom Hanks’ father in “You’ve Got Mail” and a fire fighting official in “The Towering Inferno.”', 'He won a Golden Globe for “The Slap Maxwell Story” and an Emmy Award for best supporting actor in Peter Levin’s 1987 small screen legal drama “Sworn to Silence.” Some of his recent credits include “Ray Donovan” and a recurring role on “Boardwalk Empire,” for which he won two Screen Actors Guild Awards.', 'In the groundbreaking 1980 hit “9 to 5,” he was the “sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot” boss who tormented his unappreciated female underlings - Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton - until they turned the tables on him.', 'In 1981, he was Fonda’s caring, well-mannered boyfriend, who asks her father (played by her real-life father, Henry Fonda) if he can sleep with her during a visit to her parents’ vacation home in “On Golden Pond.”', 'Opposite Dustin Hoffman in “Tootsie,” he was the obnoxious director of a daytime soap opera that Hoffman’s character joins by pretending to be a woman. Among Coleman‘s other films were “North Dallas Forty,” “Cloak and Dagger,” “Dragnet,” “Meet the Applegates,” “Inspector Gadget” and “Stuart Little.” He reunited with Hoffman as a land developer in Brad Silberling’s “Moonlight Mile” with Jake Gyllenhaal.', 'Coleman‘s obnoxious characters didn’t translate quite as well on television, where he starred in a handful of network comedies. Although some became cult favorites, only one lasted longer than two seasons, and some critics questioned whether a series starring a lead character with absolutely no redeeming qualities could attract a mass audience.', '“Buffalo Bill” (1983-84) was a good example. It starred Coleman as “Buffalo Bill” Bittinger, the smarmy, arrogant, dimwitted daytime talk show host who, unhappy at being relegated to the small-time market of Buffalo, New York, takes it out on everyone around him. Although smartly written and featuring a fine ensemble cast, it lasted only two seasons.', 'Another was 1987’s “The Slap Maxwell Story,” in which Coleman was a failed small-town sportswriter trying to save a faltering marriage while wooing a beautiful young reporter on the side.', 'Other failed attempts to find a mass TV audience included “Apple Pie,” “Drexell’s Class” (in which he played an inside trader) and “Madman of the People,” another newspaper show in which he clashed this time with his younger boss, who was also his daughter.', 'He fared better in a co-starring role in “The Guardian” (2001-2004), which had him playing the father of a crooked lawyer. And he enjoyed the voice role as Principal Prickly on the Disney animated series “Recess” from 1997-2003.', 'Underneath all that bravura was a reserved man. Coleman insisted he was really quite shy. “I’ve been shy all my life. Maybe it stems from being the last of four children, all of them very handsome, including a brother who was Tyrone Power-handsome. Maybe it’s because my father died when I was 4,” he told The Associated Press in 1984. “I was extremely small, just a little guy who was there, the kid who created no trouble. I was attracted to fantasy, and I created games for myself.”', 'As he aged, he also began to put his mark on pompous authority figures, notably in 1998’s “My Date With the President’s Daughter,” in which he was not only an egotistical, self-absorbed president of the United States, but also a clueless father to a teenager girl.', 'Dabney Coleman - his real name - was born in 1932 in Austin, Texas After two years at the Virginia Military Academy, two at the University of Texas and two in the Army, he was a 26-year-old law student when he met another Austin native, Zachry Scott, who starred in “Mildred Pierce” and other films.', '“He was the most dynamic person I’ve ever met. He convinced me I should become an actor, and I literally left the next day to study in New York. He didn’t think that was too wise, but I made my decision,” Coleman told The AP in 1984.', 'Early credits included such TV shows as “Ben Casey,” “Dr Kildare,” “The Outer Limits,” “Bonanza,” “The Mod Squad” and the film “The Towering Inferno.” He appeared on Broadway in 1961 in “A Call on Kuprin.” He played Kevin Costner’s father on “Yellowstone.”', 'Twice divorced, Coleman is survived by four children, Meghan, Kelly, Randy and Quincy, and the grandchildren Hale and Gabe Torrance, Luie Freundl and Kai and Coleman Biancaniello.', '“My father crafted his time here on earth with a curious mind, a generous heart, and a soul on fire with passion, desire and humor that tickled the funny bone of humanity,” Quincy Coleman wrote in his honor.', 'Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.

        "article": "NEW YORK — The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a day above the 40,000 level for the first time on Friday as U.S. stock indexes drifted around their records while closing out their latest winning week.', 'The Dow rose 134.21 points, or 0.3%, to 40,003.59, a day after briefly topping the 40,000 level for the first time. It and other indexes on Wall Street have been climbing since the autumn of 2022 as the U.S. economy and corporate profits have managed to hold up despite high inflation, the punishing effects of high interest rates and worries about a recession that seemed inevitable but hasn’t arrived.', 'The S&P 500, which is the much more important index for Wall Street and most retirement savers, added 6.17 points, or 0.1%, to 5,303.27. It finished just 0.1% shy of its record set on Wednesday and closed out a fourth straight week of gains. The Nasdaq composite slipped 12.35 points, or 0.1%, to 16,685.97.', 'Despite the placid movements for indexes, some feverish action was roiling underneath.

Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology has continued to build despite some warnings of a potential bubble.', 'On the losing end were GameStop and AMC Entertainment, which gave back more of their massive gains from the beginning of the week.', 'GameStop dropped 19.7% to trim its gain for the week to 27.2% after it said it expects to report a loss of up to $37 million for the three months through May 4. It also said it could sell up to 45 million shares of stock in order to raise cash.', 'Such moves can dilute the holdings of current shareholders, and it followed a similar move by AMC Entertainment. After the movie-theater chain’s stock price also got caught up in a rocket ride upward, AMC said earlier this week it would issue nearly 23.3 million shares of stock to wipe out some debt.', 'Much of the whipsaw action for it and GameStop was due to enthusiasm among investors, not because of fundamental changes to their profit prospects. Not all of those were necessarily smaller-pocketed investors buying on their phones. Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund founded by pioneering investor Jim Simons, revealed that it bought shares of both GameStop and AMC Entertainment before the end of March, though it may no longer still own them.', 'Elsewhere in financial markets, Treasury yields ticked higher, and stock indexes around the world were mixed.', 'This week was a good one for markets broadly after a report rekindled hopes that inflation is finally heading back in the right direction after a discouraging start to the year. That in turn revived hopes for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate at least once this year.', 'The federal funds rate is sitting at its highest level in more than two decades, and a cut would goose investment prices and remove some of the downward pressure on the economy.', 'The hope is that the Fed can pull off the balancing act of slowing the economy enough through high interest rates to stamp out high inflation but not so much that it causes a bad recession.', 'Of course, now that a growing percentage of traders are betting on the Fed cutting rates two times this year, if not more, some economists are cautioning the optimism may be going too far. It’s something that happens often on Wall Street.', 'While data reports recently have been better than forecast, “better than expected doesn’t mean good,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report.', 'Inflation is still higher than the Fed would like, and Bank of America’s Michael Gapen still expects the Fed to hold its main interest rate steady until cutting in December.', 'In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.41% from 4.38% late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, edged up to 4.82% from 4.80%.', 'In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 1% in Shanghai and 0.9% in Hong Kong after China’s central bank announced moves to bolster its struggling property market. It reduced required down payments for housing loans and cut interest rates for first and second home purchases, among other moves.', 'Indexes fell in Seoul, Tokyo and across much of Europe.', '• AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.', 'Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.

The left-hander allowed two runs and six hits, walked none and struck out four over six innings.', 'By winning the opener of the three-game set, the Orioles are assured of completing their 106th consecutive regular-season series without being swept. That’s the third-longest streak in major league history, behind only the 1942-44 St. Louis Cardinals (124) and 1906-09 Chicago Cubs (115).', 'Miller rebounded from his poor start to keep the Orioles in check until he was lifted with one out in the sixth.

Crawford (oblique strain) was hit on his right hand by a pitch during his rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma, which will likely delay his return from the IL. “He does not have a fracture, but he’s got some swelling going on,” manager Scott Servais said. … 2B Jorge Polanco missed a third straight game with hamstring tightness.', 'Orioles: RHP Grayson Rodriguez (shoulder) is poised to come off the injured list, manager Brandon Hyde said.
